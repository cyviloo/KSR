<BODY>Biogen Inc said the European
Patent Office granted it a patent covering certain proteins
used to produce a hepatitis B vaccine through genetic
engineering techniques.
    Robert Gottlieb, Biogen spokesman, said the company has
licensed the vaccine on a nonexclusive basis to &lt;Wellcome PLC>,
the British pharmaceutical firm, and is discussing licensing
with other companies.
    Biogen said the patent gives it the right to exclude others
from marketing hepatitis B vaccine in the 11 member countries
of the European Patent Convention.
    Gottlieb said the company has also filed a patent in other
markets, including the U.S. The vaccine is in clinical tests.
    Patents in the biotechnology field are particularly
important as the company with an exclusive patent can reap
large rewards. Recently many of the products of genetic
engineering have become the target of patent lawsuits.
    Merck and Co Inc &lt;MRK> already sells a genetically
engineered hepatitis B vaccine in the U.S. called Recombivax
HB. A subsidiary of &lt;SmithKline Beckman Corp>, SmithKline
Biologicals, based in Belgium, is selling a hepatitis B
vaccine, called Engerix-B, in Belgium.
    A SmithKline spokesman said the vaccine has also been
formally approved in Switzerland and Luxembourg and has been
authorized for market in a number of Far East countries.
    Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection common in many
parts of Africa and southeast Asia where about five pct to 15
pct of the population carry the virus. In the U.S. about
200,000 new cases occur each year.
    Last December the European Patent Ofice rejected Biogen's
patent for alpha-interferon, which Biogen said it will appeal
once it receives a formal written opinion from the office.

<BODY>Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
the U.K. Was growing more impatient with Japanese trade
barriers and warned that it would soon have new powers against
countries not offering reciprocal access to their markets.
    She told Parliament that the bid by the U.K.'s Cable and
Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> to enter the Japanese telecommunications
market was being regarded by her government as a test case.
    "I wrote to the prime minister of Japan, Mr Nakasone, on the

Wireless bid. I have not yet had a reply. We see this as a test
on how open the Japanese market really is," Thatcher said.
    Thatcher told Parliament that "shortly ... We shall have
more powers than we have now, when, for example the powers
under the Financial Services Act and the Banking Act become
available, then we shall be able to take action in cases where
other countries do not offer the same full access to financial
services as we do."
    Cable and Wireless is seeking a stake in the proposed
Japanese telecommunications rival to Kokusai Denshin Denwa.
    But the Japanese minister for post and telecommunications

    Simultaneously, the number of outsiders would be increased

<BODY>Private investors eagerly snapped up
shares of Consolidated Rail Corp, the biggest initial stock
offering in U.S. history, but some analysts warned they could
be in a for a bumpy ride at least in the near term.
    Analyst James Voytko of PaineWebber Group Inc believes some
investors who bought at the offering price of 28 dlrs will be
tempted to sell. The shares climbed 3-3/8 to 31-3/8 by midday.
Voytko said profit-taking pressure could become severe at the
35 dlr level. Others say Conrail, a combination of previously
bankrupt railroads, has good long term potential.
    "Conrail is in the best position to weather the current
tremendous price competition in the transportation industry in
general," said Drew Robertson, analyst at Atlantic Systems Inc,
a research firm.
    "It will survive and do damn well," said another analyst
who declined to be identified. He noted that Conrail's freight
trains serve heavy industry including steel and autos in major
U.S. cities in the northeast U.S. and midwest.
    Robertson noted that Conrail's traffic is less dependent on
coal than other railroads based in the east. He expects Conrail
to earn 2.85 dlrs per share in 1987.
    Voytko of PaineWebber sees another problem six months down
the road when more than 10 mln Conrail shares will be
distributed to current and former employees. He believes many
of these indivdiuals will be inclined to sell the stock.
    Robertson says it's hard to determine the psychology of the
average employe, but even if a lot of stock is sold, it would
would not hit the market as one big block. He doubts it would
create a big downward push on the price.
    "It's hard to call," said the analyst who requested
anonymity. In some cases employe loyalty may motivate
individuals to keep their shares, he said.
    Steven Lewins, analyst for Citicorp Investment Management,
believes the key to Conrail's long term outlook is how it is
able to invest surplus cash. He expects Conrail to earn 3.00
dlrs per share this year, flat in comparison with 1986, but by
1991 the picture could change dramatically if money not needed
for rail operations is invested wisely.
    By 1991, earnings could reach 4.30 dlrs per share, Lewins
said, factoring in reinvestment of free cash flow at
conservative rates.
    He believes motor freight will be one area of
diversification Conrail will explore.
    Elizabeth Dole, U.S. Secretary of Transportation, whose
department was responsible for the sale of Conrail, noted that
Conrail is required to reinvest in its rail system and cannot
defer necessary maintenance.
    For the historic offering of Conrail shares, Dole visited
the New York Stock Exchange and was photographed on the floor
wearing a locomotive engineer's cap, which she presented to
Stanley Crane, Conrail chairman and chief executive.
    The U.S. government is expected to receive about 1.88
billion dlrs for Conrail after factoring in underwriting fees
and other adjustments.
    The possibility of a recession at some time in the next
five years is another issue troubling some investors.
    Lewins says revenue-ton-miles, which he believes will climb
from 68.7 mln miles last year to 69.5 mln this year and 70.5
mln in 1988, will grow to 71.5 mln in 1991, but in a recession
year, perhaps 1989, the figure could dip to 64.2 mln.
    On the revenue side, he believes revenue per ton-mile will
be 4.7 cts in 1991, little changed from present levels and
exactly the same as in 1981.
    "Their basic business isn't going anywhere," he says,
explaining why emphasizes investment of cash flow.
    Voytko thinks Conrail can remain profitable in a recession
year. He points out his firm, PaineWebber, is not forecasting a
recession in any specific year, but as an example a 1990
recession of modest degree could knock earnings down to 2.20
dlrs per share. He estimated 3.00 dlrs per share this year and
3.35 dlrs next year. His 1988 figure reflects mostly a lowering
of the tax rate to 34 pct from 40 pct this year.
    Voytko believes the Conrail shares merit purchase at the 26
dlr level.
    Goldman, Sachs and Co was lead manager for the offering. A
total of 148 firms took part in the U.S. syndicate.

<BODY>The United Auto Workers struck
General Motors Corp's truck and bus plants at Pontiac, Mich,
General Motors said.
    General Motors' truck and bus group failed to reach an
agreement on local issues with UAW Local 594 by the union's
deadline of noon today, causing a strike by 9,000 hourly
workers at the facility, the company said.
    General Motors said it was "eager" to continue meeting with
union officials on the dispute. It was not immediately clear
whether contract talks were continuing at the facility.
    General Motors spokesman Frank Cronin said the three plants
at Pontiac stopped working "as of noon today."
    He said talks will resume Friday at 1000 EST in Pontiac.
"We're hoping (the strike) will be of very brief duration,"
Cronin said.
    Bus-manufacturing operations at one of the three
plants--the Pontiac Central facility--are being sold to
Greyhound Corp &lt;G>, although GM will retain the facility.
    Cronin said about 400 workers on the bus line will be laid
off "whenever we fulfill production commitments" on the buses,
"possibly in May."
    The Pontiac Central plant also makes medium- and heavy-duty
trucks. Assembly of the medium trucks is scheduled to move to
Janesville, Wis., in 1990, Chronin said.
    Heavy truck operations at the plant will be taken over by
GM's joint venture with Volvo AB, and all vehicle assembly
operations at the facility will eventually be ended, Chronin
said. The plant also has sheet metal operations, which are so
far unaffected, he said.
    The other two plants at Pontiac--Pontiac East and Pontiac
West--make full-size pickups and sport utility vehicles.

<BODY>Officials of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC) said merging the agency with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would not help
regulation of commodities and securities markets.
    "I don't think that a merger would solve regulatory
problems," CFTC chairman Susan Phillips told the House
Subcommittee on Conservation, Credit and Rural Development.
    "I think what does solve our problems would be working with
other agencies in a strong capacity," she said in response to a
question. "We don't want agencies to trample on our
jurisdiction either."
    CFTC Commissioner Fowler West said, "We ... do not have the
expertise to regulate securities markets. I don't think the SEC
has the expertise to regulate the futures markets."
    Increased attention to price volatility in stock index
futures markets and reports of alleged futures trading abuses
have raised concerns Congress may adopt a radically different
regulatory structure for securities and futures markets.
    Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy
and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over securities
regulation, has said he will hold hearings on the questions of
market volatility and alleged trading abuses.

<BODY>The Polish government has backed down
from some proposed price rises in the face of strong opposition
from trade unions, but has restated its commitment to economic
reforms entailing tougher discipline and austerity measures.
    Following a warning from the officially-backed OPZZ unions
that sharp price hikes could spark confrontation, the
government has agreed that food prices this year will rise an
average 9.6 pct instead of the planned 13 pct.
    A statement last night said the government had "partially
accepted" demands for the protection of the low-paid and agreed
to extend some social benefits.
    But Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski, at a separate
meeting yesterday, sharply criticised the slow pace of reforms.
    He told an economic commission that tougher discipline and
austerity measures, greater efficiency and initiative should
replace waste, red tape and inertia. He announced cost-cutting
measures affecting central administrative bodies.
    OPZZ economic expert Zbigniew Kochan welcomed the move on
food prices. "This decrease was considerable," Kochan told
Reuters today. "Also important is the fact that the government
admitted we were right and agreed to consult us over prices
from now on," he added.
    The communique made no mention of curbs on wage increases,
or price rises in sectors including transport and energy.
    The authorities have said prices could go up by as much as
26 pct as state subsidies are sharply reduced in an effort to
make the market more free and to improve efficiency.
    The OPZZ unions are officially recognised by the government
and replaced the Solidarity movement suppressed under martial
law. They claim a membership of seven million.
    Western diplomats said today the climb-down on food prices
was a limited concession. "This is a small price to pay if they
can push through the other price rises," one said, adding that
fuel and energy rises would have a more significant effect.
    He noted that there had been a concerted media campaign to
prepare people for price rises, including a major article in a
mass-circulation women's magazine, "clearly aimed at those who
do the shopping," he said.
    Other articles in the official press this week have focused
on coal, which sells to both industrial and private consumers
at far less than either the production or export costs.
    Countering scepticism from opposition sources and former
Solidarity activists as to OPZZ's role, Kochan said "It was
definitely not a question of gaining credibility, but true
concern for people's living standards."
    Deputy Prime Minister Jozef Koziol said the authorities'
main aim was not to harm workers' living standards. But he was
also quoted by the official PAP news agency as saying the
government had to take current economic realities into account.

<BODY>A proposal by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, CFTC, to raise federal limits on futures
speculative positions for certain agricultural commodity
contracts would not reverse a decline in liquidity in those
markets that started in 1981, two CFTC commissioners said.
    Commissioners William Seale and Kalo Hineman told a House
Agriculture subcommittee a recent proposal that would have the
effect of raising deferred month speculative position limits on
several agricultural commodity contracts would not
substantially increase liquidity in those months.
    "I seriously doubt that increasing speculative limits will
create a great deal of liquidity in the back months," Seale
told the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation, Credit
and Rural Development.
    Analysts have attributed much of the liquidity squeeze to a
1981 tax law change, which by changing the treatment of
so-called straddles limited the ability of futures commission
merchants to roll positions forward for tax purposes.
    CFTC Chairman Susan Phillips said only that the commission
would take into account Congress' recommendation that federal
speculative limits be raised.
    The Chicago Board of Trade and the MidAmerica Commodity
Exchange have expressed concern that the CFTC plan would
decrease spot month limits for certain of their contracts.

<BODY>Federal Reserve Board Governor
Robert Heller said the banking system could be strengthened by
permitting formation of financial services holding companies
involved in areas like banking, insurance, real estate and
securities.
    In a speech prepared for delivery in New York to the Bank
and Financial Analysts' Association, Heller said, "I believe
that increased diversification along geographic and product
lines is the key to strengthening the American banking system."
    He said he supported the idea of financial services holding
companies advocated by the Association of Bank Holding
Companies in which regulation of various bank, thrift,
insurance, investment, securities and real estate subsidiaries
would be handled on functional lines.
    "Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by the
bank to the associated institutions, and all transactions would
have to be on an arms-length basis," Heller said.
    Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks'
special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries.
    Heller said he "would require the holding company to serve
as a 'source of strength' to the bank by making a commitment to
maintain the bank's capital.
    "In other words, the bank would not be allowed to fail as
long as the holding company has a positive net worth."
    Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permitted
to own a financial services holding company, again with the
provision that capital would flow to the financial enterprise
if necessary.
    Heller said the effects of these actions "would be banks
that are at least as strong as the corporations holding them" in
which customer deposits were assured while any incentive to
"loot the bank" was removed.
    Such diversification would give access to national and
international financial services to corporations across the
United States.
    Heller said that would mean "the steady decline of America's
banks in the world financial league tables would be arrested" by
permitting them to become more competitive.

<BODY>The chairman of the CFTC, Susan
Phillips, said she does not expect the CFTC to restrict dual
trading or to intervene in the quarterly expiration of stock
index futures and their options.
     "At this time we have no plans to reexamine our policy (on
dual trading)," she told the House Subcommittee on
Conservation, Credit and Rural Development.
    She said it would not be appropriate to ban dual trading
because it would decrease market liquidity.
    Dual trading refers to the ability of futures commission
merchants to trade for their own as well as their clients'
accounts. Exchange rules prohibit a broker from attempting to
benefit from the market impact of a client's order by trading
on his own account before placing the client's order.
    CFTC has required all futures exchanges by July 1 to have
implemented audit trails permitting the reconstruction of all
trades to the nearest minute. The move was designed in part to
discourage abuse of dual trading.
    The board of directors of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
has proposed limiting but not banning dual trading in the
Standard and Poor's 500 stock index future pit.
    Phillips indicated the CFTC would not move beyond requiring
improved audit trails in its effort to allay concerns about
dual trading abuses.
    "It would be inappropriate at this point until we see how
the audit trail will work," she said in response to a question.
    On triple-witching, Phillips said recent experiments by
markets to quell price fluctuations have been quite successful
and that users of securities and derivative instruments were
still learning how to deal with the quarterly phenomenon.
    Triple-witching refers to the simultaneous expiration of
stock index futures, options on those futures and options on
certain individual stocks.
    The CFTC chairman noted the commission has heightened
surveillance of markets on triple-witching day.
    "We aren't sure any other regulatory changes are needed at
this point," Phillips said.

<BODY>The Reagan administration said the
national crisis in liability insurance eased during the past
year as the insurance industry's profits more than doubled to
11.5 billion dlrs, but some problems still persist.
    An administration working group, in an update of its report
a year ago, found that insurance premiums generally have
stabilized, but at high levels, as the crisis has abated.
    After severe financial difficulties in 1984 and 1985, the
insurance industry's rate of return last year recovered to the
same level as the performace of U.S. corporations in general,
the group said in a 98-page study.
    While the crisis has eased, the study found that liability
insurance will likely remain expensive and continue to be
difficult to obtain for some lines of coverage and for some
sectors of the American economy.
    Some types of insurance, especially associated with
environmental liability, remain unavailable for many companies
at any price, it said.
    The increased availability and the price stability for
insurance the past year has been accompanied by higher
deductibles, lower coverage limits and additional policy
restrictions, the study said.
    The administration last year unveiled a wide range of
recommendations aimed at dealing with the crisis, including 
limits on punitive damages and awards for pain, suffering and
mental anguish at 100,000 dlrs.
    Attorney General Edwin Meese told a news conference today
that the administration still supports state efforts to place
limits on damage awards and to enact other reforms of the tort
laws.
    Assistant Attorney General Richard Willard denied charges
by consumer groups that the insurance crisis was caused by
industry collusion to raise rates in violation of the antitrust
laws. Willard, the head of the working group, said excessive
jury damage awards was the main reason for the insurance
liability problem.

    The judge set May 7 for sentencing and U.S. Attorney
Rudolph Giuliani declared the government would ask that
Anderson be sent to jail.
    According to the indictment, Anderson was a prinicipal  of
the Commercial Exchange Bank and Trust Ltd of Anguilla in the
British West Indies for two years ending in 1985.
    During that time, government prosecutors said the bank
conducted operations in New York city but failed to register
with state and federal banking authorities. Depositors have
lost at least 4 mln dlrs.
    Anderson pleaded gulity only for the tax year 1984 but
admitted other tax transgressions for the previous year and
faces civil fines for both years.
    Among other things, he said he received 80,000 dlrs in 1983
from a shell corporation for lobbying for the Unification
Church. The money was given to him as a no-interest loan
repayable in 1990 but the government said it should have been
reported as income.

<BODY>Several U.S. House members urged
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, to strengthen
its proposed rules governing the sale of foreign futures and
options in the U.S.
      "I'm from the state of Illinois, and we don't want to see
Chicago's futures markets become the automobile or textile
industry of the 1980s," Rep. Lane Evans (D-Ill.) told a hearing
of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation, Credit
and Rural Development.
      U.S. exchanges have complained that the proposed
regulations would give sellers of foreign futures an edge over
domestic futures sellers because they would be subject to less
rigorous requirements, especially in the area of capital.
      Phillips said the commission has no way of requiring
foreign markets to implement the same regulatory safeguards as
in the U.S., but that the proposed rules would ensure marketing
of foreign futures and options conform to U.S. requirements.
     "If people want to enter into these (foreign) markets,
they know they will not have the same regulations," she said.
      Phillips said the commission would consider changes in
its proposal to require segregation of customer accounts and
clarify the treatment of contracts not traded on foreign
exchanges.

<BODY>British Petroleum Co Plc does not
intend to raise the price of its planned 70 dlr per share offer
for the publicly held 45 pct of Standard Oil Co, BP Managing
Director David Simon said.
    "We don't seen this as any progressive bidding game," he
told reporters at a news conference. BP now owns 55 pct of
Standard's stock.
    Simon said BP had carefully considered the amount of its
planned bid and he quoted an oil analyst, whom he would not
identify, as saying BP's careful evaluation means the company
is not going to raise its offer.
    "I think that (an increase) would be totally wrong. I think
the price is very fair and it is much to early to speculate
about ligigation," he said. "Let's wait and see how the offer
runs."
    Another official declined to speculate under what
circumstances BP might raise its bid.
    The BP official said the 70 dlrs a share offer is 7.2 times
Standard's 1986 cash flow and 56 pct above an independent
evaluation of the company's assets, including the value of its
oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves.
    He said the price Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD> &lt;SC> paid
for publicly held Shell Oil Co shares in 1985 was 5.1 times
cash flow.
    The BP official also said the 70 dlr bid is a 40 pct
premium over Standard's stock price over the past year.
    BP Group Treasurer Rodney Chase said more than half to as
much as two-third's of the 7.4 billion dlrs BP needs for its
offer will come from existing sources. The rest will be
financed by new debt.
    BP will draw in cash from its operating companies around
the world and is also arranging a five billion dlr line of
credit, he explained.
    The company's debt to equity ratio will rise 11 or 12
percentage points from the current 33 pct if the offer is
completed, Chase said. But the ratio will be back below 40 pct
within 12 months, he added.
    Chase also said 50 to 60 pct of Standard Oil's publicly
held shares are held by financial institutions.
    Simon said Standard's board was informed of the offer on
March nine and has been considering it since that time.
    He said BP does not expect any regulatory problems that
would delay completion of the acquisition. "We have informed
Washington of our intentions and we've already been an integral
part of ownership of U.S. oil reserves," he pointed out.
    Simon said there is a good chance that current world oil
prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel could be maintained, and that
the more stable market is due mostly to changes in policy in
Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to control oil production.
    "We think there are signals that current conditions are
more favorable than they have been for sometime," Simon said.
    "We have hopes for greater stability, but we do not see
prices going much higher," he added.

<BODY>British Petroleum Plc's plan to pay
7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has
signalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said.
    "I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation and
clear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and they
think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher,"
said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
    BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70
dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already
own.
    "It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won the
war and oil prices are not going to crack," said Prescott, Ball
and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier.
    "Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the
energy issues out there in the stock market, particularly those
that are acquisition targets," Lazier said.
    One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, an
energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl
Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a
Court last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock.
    Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms
falling into takeover situations for several years, with the
exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp &lt;AHC>. He said most of
the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking
which ended two years ago, and others restructured to the point
that they have become unattractive.
    U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. Exxon
Corp &lt;XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> jumped
1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco &lt;TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. Unocal
Corp &lt;UCL> rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY>
climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp &lt;AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4.
    Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to
71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4.
Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its
offer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained it
would not raise the 70 dlr bid.
    British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8.
    Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in
the first place indicates that the British oil giant has
changed its outlook for the oil industry.
    Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the
more bearish positions on oil prices.
    "They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (a
barrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hasty
retreat from that point of view," Margoshes said.
    "They are more appropriately today looking more
optimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs
(long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe that
will be exceeded," Margoshes said.
    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was
trading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel.
    Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy
up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when
oil prices were falling last year.
    They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightly
more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil
field. Analysts also said the company has other interests in
the Alaskan North Slope.
    Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely
attractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market and
has hard-to-replace reserves.
    "I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to
increase their position in the U.S. market," Dean Witter
analyst Eugene Nowak said.
    Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of the
British government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BP
stock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holding
sometime in the year beginning April one.
    After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP's reserves
would be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock is
held in the U.S.
    "The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it
into the United States. No other market can handle all that
stock," said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua.
    In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs on
revenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the year
earlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs.

<BODY>The U.S. General Accounting Office
said generic commodities certificates cost the U.S. government
in total Commodity Credit Corp outlays 107 mln to 653 mln dlrs
more than cash payments through February, 1987.
    However, GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley, in
testimony prepared for delivery to the Senate Agriculture
Committee, said short-term commodity storage cost savings
related to the use of payment-in-kind certificates could be
from about 169 mln 253 mln dlrs.
    U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said the
issuance of 8.5 billion dlrs of certificates in fiscal years
1986-88 could cost as much as 550 mln dlrs more than cash
outlays.
    In his prepared remarks to the Senate panel, Amstutz
stressed that USDA was "very pleased with the success of using
commodity certificates" and looked forward to their continued
use.
    He said the cost of using certificates must be weighed
against immediate benefits, including greater market liquidity,
improved market price competitiveness, higher farm income,
improved debt situation and decreased carrying charges,
especially pertaining to 1985 crop loans.
    Crowley said future government storage costs would be
reduced only if in the long run certificates led to a decrease
in CCC-owned inventory.
    "We believe that such a reduction, if it occurs, will not
be large," Crowley said.
    Crowley also said that because certificate amounts are not
included in the federal budget's outlay totals at the time of
issuance, they could "lessen the usefulness of the budget."
    Crowley conceded that certificates help farmers avoid
storage costs, give them marketing flexibility and enhance
farmers' incomes.
    He also said certificates have benefited the grain industry
by giving it easier access to CCC-owned grain at market prices.

<BODY>Bank of England Governor Robin
Leigh-Pemberton said the Paris pact agreed between six leading
industrialised nations set no nominal exchange rate targets.
    Leigh-Pemberton said in oral evidence to a select committee
that "we did not swap numbers - we reached an understanding" on
how to cooperate towards stabilizing currencies at around their
current levels.
    He said the accord had brought Britain into a form of joint
currency float - but one which let it still purse an
independent monetary policy. "I would concede that, since the
Louvre Accord, we are acting as if we are in something,"
Leigh-Pemberton said.
    "The Louvre and Plaza accords show there is a very effective
role for the (Group of) seven central banks to operate together"
towards stabilising exchange rates," Leigh-Pemberton said.
    He did not mention this week's intervention by central
banks to support the dollar, after markets decided to test the
accord.
     Leigh-Pemberton said that "the effectiveness of this
(cooperation) is actually larger than many of us had thought in
the pre-Plaza days" before September 1985.
    He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly
sought by the six nations, and noted that "we are more effective
in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing."
    He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly

in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing."
    Leigh-Pemberton said that, in principle, the Bank of
England favoured full EMS membership for sterling, provided
such a move did not endanger U.K. Anti-inflation monetary
policy. Asked whether he wanted to see U.K. Interest rates
lower, he said "the two half point cuts (this month in banks'
base lending rates) have been appropriate up until now."
    Leigh-Pemberton said he preferred a "cautious step-by-step
approach" to reducing short term interest rates, not least
because "we have a potential problem with inflation."
    Underlying U.K. Inflation was currently around 4.0 pct, "one
of the highest" among industrialised nations, he added.
    Leigh-Pemberton said the Bank of England had not wanted
base rates to fall before the unveiling of the 1987/88 budget
on March 17, but he said pressure from financial markets for
such a move had proved irresistible. Base rates are now at 10
pct.
    Regarding sterling's relationship with oil, Leigh-Pemberton
said that the pound could be seen being undervalued overall.
    He said the current oil price of some 18 dlrs a barrel
might suggest a level of 74 on the Bank of England's sterling
index, when compared with the index's level before oil prices
dropped from around the 30 dlr level. The index, base 1975,
closed here today at 72.1, unchanged from the previous close.

<BODY>Jorge Cardenas, manager of Colombia's
coffee growers' federation, said he did not believe any
important decisions would emerge from an upcoming meeting of
the International Coffee Organization (ICO).
    The ICO executive board is set to meet in London from March
31 and could decide to call a special council session by the
end of April to discuss export quotas.
    "It's going to be a routine meeting, an update of what has
been happening in the market, but it's unlikely any major
decisions are taken," Cardenas told journalists.
    Earlier this month, talks in London to re-introduce export
quotas, suspended in February 1986, ended in failure.
    Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria, also talking to
reporters at the end of the weekly National Coffee Committee
meeting, said the positions of Brazil and of the United States
were too far apart to allow a prompt agreement on quotas.
    Brazil's coffee chief Jorio Dauster said yesterday Brazil
would not change its coffee policies.
    Cardenas said the market situation was getting clearer
because the trade knew the projected output and stockpile
levels of producers.
    He said according to ICO statistics there was a shortfall
of nine mln (60-kg) bags on the world market between October,
the start of the coffee year, and February.

<BODY>Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker said he opposes legislation to deny primary dealer
status to firms from countries that do not grant U.S. firms
equal access to their government debt markets.
    In a letter to House Banking Committee chairman Fernand St.
Germain, Volcker warned that it could lead to retaliation
against U.S. firms already operating in other countries.
    The committee approved the legislation yesterday. They said
its impact would be felt only by Japanese firms designated as
primary dealers in U.S. government securities since other
countries would meet the equal access rule.
    "Even Japan, at which the proposal seems to be particularly
aimed, has made a number of advances in opening its market to
U.S. firms," Volcker said.
    The legislation gives the administration six months to
negotiate equal access for U.S. firms in the foreign government
securities markets before the ban on foreign dealers in the
U.S. would take effect.
    Volcker said more progress could be made by continuing
negotiations without adopting the bill's more rigid approach.

<BODY>&lt;Bank of Montreal> is confident a
solution will be found to Brazil's foreign debt problem and is
not considering declaring its Brazilian loans non-performing,
president Grant Reuber said.
    Speaking to reporters after a speech to a Toronto business
group, Reuber said: "I think at this stage it is really too
early to say very much about (the Brazilian debt situation) but
we're pretty confident that things will work out."
    He declined to comment on when such a settlement was
likely. Bank of Montreal had 1.98 billion dlrs in loans to
Brazil as of last September 30, the most of any Canadian bank.
     Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68
billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt.
     Asked if Bank of Montreal were considering declaring its
Brazil loans non-performing, Reuber replied: "We haven't really
got to that point because we don't think we will have to face
that issue."
    Some bankers in the U.S. said earlier this week that slow
progress in talks between Brazil and its major foreign lenders
has increased the likelihood that U.S. banks will declare their
Brazil loans non-performing at the end of the quarter.
     Reuber told reporters the bank was still pondering its
strategy regarding possible entry into the securities business
after June 30 when banks and other financial institutions will
be allowed full participation in the Ontario securities
industry.
    He said price would help determine if the bank formed its
own securities unit or acquired an existing investment dealer,
adding that asking prices for some dealers seem "fairly high."
    Asked about plans for wholly owned Harris Bankcorp Inc, of
Chicago, Reuber said Harris might consider acquiring more small
community banks around Chicago.
    "In addition, I think we are giving some consideration to
the possibility of extension into other states," Reuber said of
Harris, although he added that any such move was unlikely this
year.
    In his speech, focusing on current free trade talks between
the U.S. and Canada, Reuber said failure to reach a deal would
not represent a calamity for Canada but could lower Canada's
standard of living, raise unemployment and reduce the country's
world trading influence.

<BODY>USX Corp chairman David Roderick said
the company had ended talks with British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP>
about the possible sale of some energy assets and said USX has
no immediate restructuring plans for its oil businesses.
    "We have terminated our discussions," Roderick told Reuters
after a speech to the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association
here. He said USX was not conducting talks with any other
possible buyer of its energy assets.
    Earlier today, BP said it planned to offer 70 dlrs per
share for the Standard Oil Co's &lt;SRD> publicly held stock.
    USX said in December the company had held formal
discussions with BP about the potential sale of some of its
overseas oil assets and USX had received expressions of
interest from a half dozen other oil companies.
    Roderick, in response to a question, said USX had no
immediate plans to restructure its Marathon Oil Co, or Texas
Oil and Gas Corp. He said USX also did not plan to sell any of
its 49 pct interest in the giant Yates Field in west Texas.
    "We want to maintain our production in the Yates Field
during these difficult times," Roderick added.
    In response to a question, Roderick also said he did not
know whether Australian investor Robert Holmes a Court was
accumulating USX stock. In recent days, traders have suggested
Holmes a Court was buying additional shares.
    Roderick said Carl Ichan, who terminated an eight billion
dlr hostile takeover plan for USX in January, continued to hold
a sizable interest in the company. "Mr. Ichan still apparently
has 11.4 pct. He hasn't bought any more stock or sold any,"
Roderick said. "He's a very satisfied shareholder right now. I
talk with him monthly."
    In his speech, Roderick predicted the fall in the value of
the dollar would set the stage for the U.S. to solve its trade
deficit problem which totaled 170 billion dlrs in 1986.
    "I expect by the early 1990s the U.S. will be running a net
trade surplus," Roderick said. "I think the worst is over and
we can look forward to stability and upward movement ahead."
    However, the USX chairman warned that European trading
partners may resist the turn in the U.S. trade deficit. "Some
economic discomfort must be transferred from the United States
to our friends, trading partners and allies."

operating profitability in the medium term.
    Cut were BankAmerica's senior debt to Ba-1 from Baa-3,
subordinated debt to Ba-3 from Ba-1, preferred stock to B-1

<BODY>Debt securities of major U.S. banks
came under light selling pressure in secondary trading on the
heels of Standard and Poor's Corp's downgrade of six money
center banks late yesterday, analysts and traders said.
    But they described market response as muted because the S
and P action came as no surprise. Besides, many participants
had already shied away from bank issues following Brazil's
suspension of interest payments last month, traders added.
    "The downgrades were expected for some time. In fact, you
can argue that S and P is lagging the market," commented one
trader.
    On February 20, Brazil said it would suspend interest
payments on about 68 billion dlrs owed to foreign commercial
banks. No date was established for the renewal of payments.
    In its action, Standard and Poor's cited the exposure to
major Latin American debtor countries of Chase Manhattan Corp
Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC>.
    The rating agency also downgraded Mellon Financial Corp
higher non-performing assets and weaker operating results
rather than the international debt problem.
    "The S and P downgrades were a non-event," a trader said.
"Anyone who was caught unaware was not on top of the situation
anyway."
    Said another trader, "People talked about this before and
after S and P's announcement. There was not much reaction among
bank issues today, though prices are still below par."
    Still, market watchers said the action further undermined
sentiment for bank paper.
    Because of Brazil's suspension of interest payments, U.S.
bank paper has underperformed such other sectors as utilities,
telephones and industrials, analysts pointed out.
    Even though Standard and Poor's affirmed the debt ratings
of Citicorp &lt;CCI>, Bankers Trust New York &lt;BT>, Bank of Boston
Corp &lt;BKB> and J.P. Morgan and Co Inc &lt;JPM>, few buyers can be
found for securities issued by those banks, traders said.
    "Let's face it. Investors believe these banks are also
exposed to Latin and other debtor countries. And investors buy
on perceptions," said one broker.
    About the only bright spots in an otherwise dull banking
sector of the secondary corporate market are U.S. regional
banks and Japanese banks because investors perceive them as
less exposed to the debtor nations, analysts pointed out.

<BODY>Royal Bank of Canada Chairman Allan
Taylor said Ottawa and the provinces risk weakening the
country's financial system if they do not agree on a harmonized
regulatory regime for financial institutions.
    Taylor also said it was vital that the federal government 
retain its existing powers under Ottawa's major new proposals
to revamp the country's financial system.
    "Unless great care is taken now, in the detailed drafting
and implementation of regulatory change, we could actually end
up weakening our financial system," Taylor told a business
luncheon.
    "Also, we must avoid costly and inefficient duplication of
regulation and supervision between federal and provincial
authorities," Taylor continued.
    Earlier this week Federal Minister of State for Finance,
Tom Hockin, said progress was being made with his provincial
counterparts on the proposals that involve removing the
traditional barriers separating the banking, securities and 
insurance sectors.
    The governments are attempting to resolve a jurisdictional
dispute over who regulates what under the new system. The
provinces have traditionally had authority in the securities
field while Ottawa oversaw the banking sector.
    But the Chairman of Canada's largest bank stressed that 
Ottawa should retain its regulatory powers to "preserve an
efficient, competitive, national financial system."
    On the free trade talks under way with the U.S., Taylor
said Canadian negotiators must insure banks have as much access
to the American market as U.S. institutions are granted here.
    He told a new conference later he was "reasonably
confident" the Canadian side was making reciprocity in
financial services an issue at the negotiating table.

<BODY>Many London equity dealers doubt whether
the much publicised flood of Japanese investment into the U.K.
Equity market will be as large as some analysts have forecast.
    There has recently been much speculation that the Japanese
would look towards the U.K. Stock market for investment
opportunities on a much larger scale when the new fiscal year
begins next month. Last October's reorganisation of the stock
market, known as 'Big Bang', paved the way for greater
participation by overseas investors.
    Some analysts believe the Japanese have earmarked massive
sums for investment in Europe.
    Both the London and Tokyo markets have moved ahead strongly
since the start of this year. But London has lagged behind in
real terms and therefore is now beginning to look like giving a
better return on any funds that are reserved for equity
investment. Sterling's firmness also means there are profits to
be made from the currency turn. However, many equity dealers
polled by Reuters think that the Japanese will shy away from
London and continue to invest in instruments such as U.S.
Government securities.
    Even if they do diversify from their old stamping grounds
they will head for the U.S. Equity market before they come to
the European stock markets, one dealer predicted.
    "The Japanese, although very aggressive in markets that they
know, tend to be more conservative in those they don't...Even
if they do come to London in a big way they would tend to go
more for the fixed interest gilt edged market rather than the
more volatile equities," he added.
    He also cited the forthcoming U.K. General election as
another factor in keeping Far Eastern money out of the London
stock market.
    "The Japanese do not like too much uncertainty and a general
election creates just the kind that will keep them on the
sidelines," one trader said.
    There are also doubts whether the Japanese would find the
track records of U.K. Companies strong enough to make them
willing to invest heavily. "Our industrial and manufacturing
output may be looking better, but it must still look pretty
uninspiring to the Japanese," one broker said.
    Some market participants, however, are a little more
bullish and do expect more, although not a massive amount, of
Far Eastern funds to come to London in the short term.
    They point out that capital gains on U.S. Bonds, a market
in which the Japanese are traditionally heavy players, have
been eroded because of the fall in the U.S. Dollar and this
could prompt them to move funds out of the U.S. But even those
who are mildly bullish concede that Japanese investors on the
London exchange would almost certainly confine themselves to
longer term investment in 10 or 15 leading 'blue chip' issues,
which may include industrial giants such as ICI, Hanson Trust,
British Petroleum, Glaxo and Unilever.
    One analyst said he believed if there was such investment
in blue chip issues, recently privatised companies such as
British Gas and British Telecom could be left out in the cold.
    He said that with an election coming up, overseas investors
would be worried that a Labour victory would bring a policy of
re-nationalisation of such companies. The Labour party has in
the past said it would do this.
    Some of the recent rise in U.K. Equities has anticipated an
increase in Japanese buying in the near future.

<BODY>French Agricultural Minister
Francois Guillaume warned that France would flatly reject
proposed reforms of the European Community, EC, cereals, sugar
and oilseeds sectors, which he said would disrupt these
markets.
    The EC Commission's proposals to shorten the intervention
period and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase the
financial burden on the sugar producers will also result in
lower real prices for producers, he told farmers here.
    "I give you my word that France, while it will not reject
technical adjustments or serious discussion, will simply reply
in the negative to these bad reforms," Guillaume told the annual
conference of the country's major farm union, FNSEA 
(Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles).
    Community agricultural ministers are due to meet again
Monday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spiralling
EC output and fix farm prices for 1987/88.
    Relations between the government and farmers have become
strained in France in recent months.
    There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations by
farmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices and
further cutbacks in Community milk output.
    But Guillaume's warning that he would reject reorganisation
of the EC cereal and sugar markets -- France being a major
producer of both crops -- won him warm applause from the
FNSEA's farmers.
    His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for the
complete dismantling of the system of cross border taxes
designed to smooth out currency differences known as Monetary
Compensatory Amounts, MCA's, however, are unlikely to avoid
further protests by producers.
    Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to go
ahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroad
against the EC Commission's proposals to overhaul the farm
sector.
    "The Minister's proposals back up our determination to
organise union action in the coming weeks," he told reporters,
adding that this could also act in Guillaume's favour on a
ministerial level.
    Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before being
appointed farm minister last spring.
    Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt that
Guillaume was doing a good job as farm minister.
    There have been certain advances on cutting production
costs, reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid, but
there are still areas where more could be done such as on
farmers' indebtedness, he said.
    Guillaume told the conference the government will make
available 2.4 billion francs (396 mln dlrs) to help producers
reduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire.
    The government has already announced financial aid for the
milk sector and it was not clear how much of the package
announced today was new aid, Lacombe said.

<BODY>billion-dlr package of budget deficit reductions, half through
unspecificed new revenues, to cut the 1988 deficit with a goal
of balancing the budget in 1991 under a new law's target.
    The committee went over a package of deficit reductions
proposed by its chairman, Democrat Lawton Chiles of Florida,
which he said would reach the 108-billion-dlr deficit in 1988
under the Gramm-Rudman budget law -- using President Reagan's
economic estimates.
    Using the Congressional Budget Office estimates, which
Congress usually relies on, would produce a deficit of 134
billion dlrs, Chiles said.
    Under the Chiles plan, deficits would be cut from
anticipated levels by nearly 110 billion dlrs over four years
to produce a 1991 balanced budget--the target of the Gramm
Rudman law.
    For 1988, the Chiles formula would cut the deficit by 37
billion dlrs, half through defence and non defence savings,m
the rest through revenues.
    Defence would be cut nearly 6.9 billion dlrs. Reagan
proposed hiking outlays by some 8 billion dlrs.
    His non defence budget savings, including health, welfare,
agricultural, government services and reduced interest
payments, amount to 11.6 billion dlrs.

<BODY>Japanese-owned Honda American
Manufacturing Co has exported the first U.S.-built cars ever
sold overseas by a foreign-owned auto company, a Honda
spokesman said.
    The subsidiary of Honda Motor Co Ltd &lt;HMC.T> of Japan
shipped 200 of its popular Accord cars to Taiwan earlier this
month, the spokesman said. The company might also eventually
send U.S.-made cars to Japan, he said.
    The automaker said it would not boost its U.S. imports of
cars from Japan, but instead make up demand for its cars in the
U.S. by increasing U.S. production.
    The shipment to Taiwan was part of planned shipments to
San-Yan Industries of Taiwan of about 2,000 Accords a year.
    Honda said it does not make Accords in Taiwan, and is
prevented by Taiwanese import restrictions from shipping them
there from Japan.
    Those restrictions were loosened this year to allow imports
from the United States. Previously no imports of foreign-built
cars were allowed, the spokesman said.
    The Accords were built at Honda's U.S. car and motorcycle
production facility at Marysville, Ohio. Honda in the past has
sent motorcycles from Marysville to Europe and Australia, and
has sent cars to Canada.
    Honda's U.S. output would have to be adjusted to meet
changing U.S. demand, the spokesman said. He quoted American
Honda president Tetsuo Chino as saying, "Honda will not
increase U.S. imports beyond the current level even if
voluntary export restrictions on Japanese cars are lifted."    
 Analysts say there are few signs Japan's restrictions will be
lifted.
    Honda might decide by the end of this year whether to
expand its U.S. production, the spokesman said.
    Honda said it is considering building either of its two new
luxury models--the "Legend" or "Integra"--in the United States.
    The Legend and Integra, two models of the company's Acura
line, were introduced last March. If the cars prove popular
enough, one of them could be built at the Ohio plant, or at a
new factory, the spokesman said.
    The spokesman said it is possible Acuras built in the
United States could be shipped back to Japan. However, he said
that decision has not yet been made, and would follow the
decision to build the cars in the United States.
    If demand for either one of the two cars reaches 100,000
vehicles a year, Honda could decide to build the cars in the
U.S., the company said.
    Sales of the Integra through February have outpaced the
Legend--35,768 against 29,824--but the spokesman said Honda
expects sales to "lean more heavily toward Legend" this year
because a two-door Legend has been added to the line.

<BODY>A huge five billion dlr credit facility
being syndicated for two subsidiaries of British Petroleum Co
Plc &lt;BP.L> should be well received in the market, given the
relatively generous terms it carries, banking sources said.
    The sources said they believe the committed four year
revolving credit - the largest of its kind in the euromarkets -
carries a facility fee of 1/8 pct and that drawings will be at
1/8 pct over the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor).
    Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York, which is arranging
the financing in conjunction with its London operation, was not
available to commment on the terms.
    BP announced it was arranging the financing earlier today
as part of its planned tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard
Oil Co that it does not own already.
    In addition to the revolving credit, BP also is arranging a
U.S. commercial paper program for an as yet undetermined
amount, which will be supported by the revolver.
    Bankers noted that the terms on the new facility compare
extremely favourably to those on other short-term facilities
for which pricing has turned extremely fine due to competition
for the mandates. It also contrasts with the 1/16 pct fee BP
paid on a recent 1.5 billion dlr refinancing of some existing
debt.
    Earlier today a Morgan Guaranty official, while declining
to reveal the pricing on the facility said that banks would be
"compensated fairly" since this is a special purpose facility
which must be completed quickly, with the signing expected in
about 10 days.
    The facility is only being syndicated among BP's
relationship banks and therefore has large individual
commitments from the banks. Lead managers are being recruited
at the 200 mln dlr level, co-lead managers at 125 mln and
managers at 75 mln.
    However, bankers said that despite the size it is likely
the financing will get done quickly since banks will want to be
seen as supporting the relationship.
    The financing is being arranged in the name of BP
International and BP North America.

<BODY>Extracts from a report by Italy's Budget
Ministry on the country's economic development in 1986 showed
gross domestic product (GDP) 2.7 pct higher in real terms than
in 1985 but a rise in unemployment.
    GDP calculated at 1980 prices rose to 434,682 billion lire
last year from 423,064 billion in 1985. On a current prices
basis, GDP was up 11 pct, totalling 894,362 billion lire in
1986 against 805,754 billion in 1985.
     But growth was insufficient to prevent a rise in
unemployment to 11.1 pct last year from 10.3 pct in 1985, the
ministry said.
    The report said falling oil prices and the depreciation of
the dollar during 1986 had favoured oil-importing countries
such as Italy.
    These factors helped Italy cut inflation to an average 6.3
pct in 1986, down from 9.3 pct in 1985.
    They also helped a major improvement in the trade balance.
    On the basis of data recently recalculated by the national
statistics institute Istat, Italy had a trade deficit in 1986
of 3,722 billion lire, the report said. This slightly revises a
previous deficit figure of 3,717 billion issued by Istat and
compares with a negative balance of 23,085 billion for 1985.

VOLCKER REAFFIRMS G
-6 NEGOTIATING PROCESS
    WASHINGTON, March 26 - Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker urged Congress to allow the government to continue its
flexible negotiations on exchange rates through procedures such
as the recent Paris meeting of industrialized countries.
    In a letter to House Banking Committee chairman Fernand St.
Germain, Volcker said he opposed legislation to formalize
international negotiations on exchange rates and to require
Treasury Secretary James Baker to disclose plans for currency
intervention.
    Volcker's letter was written March 24 in advance of the
committee's March 25 approval of the proposed legislation.
    "The fundamental policy objectives of the United States can
best be implemented in a more flexible framework, such as
through the recent meeting in Paris of Finance Ministers and
Central Bank governors," Volcker said.
    He recommended Congress not lock the administration into
formal procedures for international exchange rate negotiations
to achieve specific exchange rate goals.
    "The achievement of a sustainable pattern of U.S.
international transactions and more stability in exchange rates
are ones with which I remain sympathetic," he said.
    The Banking Committee's bill directs the administration to
to start negotiations to reach a competitive exchange rate for
the U.S. dollar "runs the risk of build up potentially
destabilizing market expectations," Volcker said.
    A requirement that Baker disclose his intervention policy
could reduce the usefulness of intervention as a tool to deal
with exchange rate volatility, Volcker added.
    Baker has also opposed the legislation which will be
wrapped into a major trade bill for consideration in the House
in late April. The Senate will consider its version of the
trade bill in May.

<BODY>Farm-state Senators indicated they
may broaden a Farm Credit System rescue package to include aid
for borrowers from private lenders such as commercial banks, as
well as the farm credit system.
    Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate
Agriculture subcommittee responsible for farm credit, said
legislation to rescue the financially-troubled system should
provide help to borrowers from all lenders to agriculture.
    "We must provide some form of interest rate buydown,
principal reduction relief for all eligible farmers and
ranchers regardless of their lending institution," Boren said.
    Boren's statement received bipartisan support from Sen.
James McClure, R-Idaho, who agreed that the aid package should
cover all lenders to agriculture.
    The comments by Senators of both parties, plus endorsements
for the across-the-board approach from the nation's largest
farm organization, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and
from the system itself, appeared to significantly broaden the
focus of the rescue legislation for the farm credit system.
Until now, agriculture officials had focused exclusively on how
to resurrect the failing system.
    Boren said borrowers from private lenders such as
commercial banks and life insurance companies must be included
in the aid package because "it would not be fair to address
only the problems of Farm Credit System borrowers."
    However, Boren and other proponents of an across-the-board
interest rate or principal buydown did not say how much the
broad approcah would cost.
    But Neil Harl, professor of economics at Iowa State
University told the hearing the cost could be in the range of
3.5 billion dlrs annually.

<BODY>The federal Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) proposed new rules that would require
accounting firms that audit public companies to submit to a
periodic outside review of their operations.
    The SEC voted unanimously to seek public comment on the
plan, under which an accounting firm would have to hire another
firm to conduct a so-called "peer review" every three years or
lose the right to audit public companies.
    SEC officials conceded peer review would not end all
audit failures but said they hoped it would eliminate audits by
clearly unqualified firms and individuals.
    "Peer review will not stop all bad audits; we recognize
that," SEC Chief Accountant Clarence Sampson told the five SEC
commissioners.
    "But we hope the rule will go far to eliminate audits
performed by individuals without the necessary skills to
conduct a proper audit," Sampson said.
    The move is largely symbolic, since firms and individuals
responsible for auditing 84 pct of all public companies already
voluntarily undergo peer review every three years, under an
accounting industry self-regulatory plan.
    But the SEC has been under pressure for years from some
federal lawmakers to make the accounting industry more open and
accountable to the public.
    Agency officials estimated that a peer review would cost
the average accounting firm between 1,500 and 2,500 dlrs, or
500 to 750 dlrs a year.
    "I don't think that (cost) is a dispositive issue," SEC
Chairman John Shad said. "It's within a reasonable range of
cost."
    The proposal would exempt foreign auditors of non-U.S.
companies required to file financial reports with the SEC.

and other selected equipment to dealers and consults with
dealers on their service systems requirements.
    "Kent-Moore will assume responsibility for the advertised

<BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
may downgrade British Petroleum Co PLC's 3.5 billion dlrs of
debt and Standard Oil Co's 3.8 billion dlrs of debt.
    The agency cited British Petroleum's 7.4 billion dlr tender
offer today for the remaining 45 pct of Standard Oil shares it
does not already own.
    Moody's said that while British Petroleum has greatly
strengthened its capital structure over the past few years,
this acquisition would seriously affect the company's
liquidity, leverage and interest coverage.
    Moody's noted that British Petroleum would use more than
two billion dlrs of excess cash and marketables and about five
billion dlrs of new acquisition debt to fund the transaction.
    In addition, the minority interest and deferred income
taxes attributable to Standard Oil would be excluded from
British Petroleum's capitalization. That would result in a
total debt to capital ratio of nearly 50 pct, Moody's said.
    The rating agency said it would study B.P.'s strategy to
restore financial flexibility after the acquisition. Moody's
said that may include divestiture of various petroleum and
non-petroleum assets and operations of B.P. and Standard.
    But Moody's noted that after the major asset writedown and
divestiture progress achieved by Standard Oil in 1985, fewer
non-petroleum assets are available for sale.
    Under review are the A-1 senior debt of issues guaranteed
by British Petroleum, including Eurobonds of BP Capital B.V.,
debentures of BP North America Finance Corp, Eurodebt of
British Petroleum B.V., BPCA Finance Ltd and BP Canadian
Holdings Ltd, debentures and medium-term notes of BP North
America Inc. Also, the A-1 debt of Standard Oil and Sohio
Pipeline, and debentures of Sohio/BP Trans-Alaska Pipeline
guaranteed severally and not jointly by B.P. and Standard.

<BODY>British Petroleum Co PLC may have to
raise its planned 70 dlrs a share tender offer for the publicly
traded shares of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD>, analysts said.
    "There's a lot of speculation here that someway or other
they would be forced to come up with another bid," said Rosario
Ilaqua of L.F. Rothschild.
    And despite BP managing director David Simon's denial today
that BP would raise the offer, the analysts said that remained
a distinct possibility.
    Analysts said they base their thinking on Royal Dutch/Shell
Group's &lt;RD> &lt;SC> bid to buy the outstanding stake of Shell Oil
Co in 1984 and 1985. Royal Dutch/Shell eventually raised its
initial 55 dlrs a share offer to 60 dlrs a share, after
lawsuits by minority shareholders.
    "I think they're going to have to go a little higher
eventually, just as Royal Dutch/Shell had to go a little higher
for the Shell Oil minority shares," Bruce Lazier of Prescott
Ball and Turben said. He estimated a price of 75 dlrs a share.
    Royal Dutch/Shell offered 55 dlrs a share for the 30.5 pct
of Shell Oil it did not already own in January of 1984. After
objections from minority shareholders about the price, Royal
Dutch/Shell raised its bid and began a 58 dlrs a share tender
offer in April 1984.
    But shareholders sued and a court blocked completion of the
offer. After months of wrangling over the worth of Shell Oil,
Royal Dutch/Shell agreed to another two dlrs increase.
    It ended up paying 5.67 billion dlrs for the outstanding
Shell Oil stake, a significant premium to its original bid of
about 5.2 billion dlrs.
    The analysts made their comments before Simon's remarks at
a BP press conference in New York this afternoon.
    Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc told
clients this morning that a sweetened offer was possible. The
analyst said the bid could be raised by two dlrs a share.
    Analysts do not expect regulatory hurdles because of the
Royal Dutch/Shell group precedent. But there may be shareholder
lawsuits for the same reason, they said.
    Goldman Sachs and Co, BP's investment advisor, advised the
Shell Oil board in 1984 and 1985.

<BODY>Standard Oil Co expects the sale of
assets and federal tax refunds resulting from last year's loss
to add about one billion dlrs to its normal cash flows from
operations in 1987, its annual report said.
    Last year, the report noted, the cash flow from operations
dropped to 1.8 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion dlrs in 1985 and
3.2 billion dlrs in 1984 due principally to lower oil prices.
    The report, prepared before British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP>
disclosed plans to seek the rest of Standard's stock, put 1987
capital spending at 1.6 billion dlrs, down from the 1.7 billion
dlrs projected in January.
    Standard's capital spending totaled 1.77 billion dlrs in
1986.
    The report showed a decline in proven oil reserves to 2.41
billion barrels at the end of 1986 from 2.65 billion barrels a
year earlier as discoveries and other additions dropped to 11.4
mln barrels last year from 23.2 mln in 1985.
    But it said gas reeserves rose to 7.31 trillion cubic feet
from 7.22 trillion at the end of 1985 despite a 30.9 mln cubic
feet downward revision in previous reserve estimates during
1986. Discoveries and other additions totaled 200.5 billion
cubic feet last year, up from 175.9 billion in 1985, it added.
    Standard said both oil and gas production increased last
year -- to 726,600 barrels per day from 719,700 barrels the
previous day and to 154.4 mln cubic feet daily from 10.1 mln in
1985.
    But the average sales price of both dropped -- to 13.83
dlrs per barrel from 26.43 dlrs for oil in 1985 and to 1.49
dlrs per thousand cubic feet from 2.18 dlrs a year earlier.
    Standard said its refined product sales also rose last
year, to 644,500 barrels per day from 604,200 barrels daily in
1985.

<BODY>The former chief currency
dealer of Herstatt Bank, which collapsed in 1974 on foreign
exchange speculation in West Germany's biggest banking crash,
can stand trial for damages, a court ruled.
    The court overturned a claim by Danny Dattel that a case
for damages should not be allowed after such a long interval.
    Herstatt creditors are seeking 12.5 mln marks from Dattel,
whom they accuse of causing losses at the bank of over 500 mln
marks by manipulating forward foreign exchange contracts.
    The crash of the private Herstatt bank with losses of over
one billion marks stunned West Germany's business community,
and led to a tightening of banking regulations.
    The losses were even greater than the 480 mln marks
announced recently by Volkswagen as a result of fraud in
currency transactions.
    Ivan Herstatt, managing director of the bank when it
collapsed, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in
1984 but appealed. Six other people associated with the bank
were jailed in 1983.
    But Dattel was freed from prosecution after he produced
medical evidence of paranoia caused by Nazi persecution during
his childhood, which might have led him to take his own life.

<BODY>Energy and Mines Minister Arturo
Hernandez Grisanti today told a meeting of regional oil
exporters the next few months will be critical to efforts to
achieve price recovery and stabilize the market.
     Hernandez said while OPEC and non-OPEC nations have
already made some strides in their efforts to strengthen the
market, the danger of a reversal is always present.
    "March and the next two or three months will be a really
critical period," Hernandez said. He said, "We will be able to
define a movement, either towards market stability and price
recovery or, depending on the market, a reversal."
    Earlier this week, Hernandez said Venezuela's oil price has
averaged just above 16 dlrs a barrel for the year to date. If
OPEC achieves its stated goal of an 18 dlrs a barrel average
price, he said, Venezuela's should move up to 16.50 dlrs.
    Hernandez spoke today at the opening of the fifth
ministerial meeting of the informal group of Latin American and
Caribbean oil exporters, formed in 1983.
    Ministers from member states Ecuador, Mexico,
Trinidad-Tobago and Venezuela are attending the two day
conference, while Colombia is present for the first time as an
observer.
    Hernandez defined the meeting as an informal exchange of
ideas about the oil market. However, the members will also
discuss ways to combat proposals for a tax on imported oil
currently before the U.S. Congress.
    Following the opening session, the group of ministers met
with President Jaime Lusinchi at Miraflores, the presidential
palace. The delegations to the conference are headed by
Hernandez of Venezuela, Energy Minister Javier Espinosa of
Ecuador, Energy Minister Kelvin Ramnath of Trinidad-Tobago,
Jose Luis Alcudiai, assistant energy secretary of Mexico and
Energy Minister Guilermno Perry Rubio of Colombia.

<BODY>International Business Machines Corp
said scientists at its Zurich research laboratory have taken a
key step toward developing a method of testing computer chips
with a laser.
    The technique is important, IBM said, because it could lead
to the development of tools that can determine the quality of
microscopic-sized computer chips without damaging them.
    IBM said chip makers will need such advanced testing
methods to aid them in developing the next generation of
semiconductors.
    These chips will be smaller than today's chips but will be
able to store vastly greater amounts of information.
    IBM said its technique uses a laser light for "contactless"
measuring of electrical signals on metal lines similar to the
kind found in computer chip circuitry.
    It said that using commercially available lasers, the
method should permit measurements of circuits with a width of
one micrometer or less.
    A micrometer is about 80 times smaller than the thickness

<BODY>Farm-state senators indicated they
may broaden a Farm Credit System rescue package to include aid
for borrowers from private lenders such as commercial banks, as
well as the farm credit system.
    Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate
Agriculture subcommittee responsible for farm credit, said
legislation to rescue the financially-troubled system should
provide help to borrowers from all lenders to agriculture.
    "We must provide some form of interest rate buydown,
principal reduction relief for all eligible farmers and
ranchers regardless of their lending institution," Boren said.
    Boren's statement received bipartisan support from Sen.
James McClure, R-Idaho, who agreed that the aid package should
cover all lenders to agriculture.
    The comments by Senators of both parties, plus endorsements
for the across-the-board approach from the nation's largest
farm organization, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and
from the system itself, appeared to significantly broaden the
focus of the rescue legislation for the farm credit system.
Until now, agriculture officials had focused exclusively on how
to resurrect the failing system.
    Boren said borrowers from private lenders such as
commercial banks and life insurance companies must be included
in the aid package because "it would not be fair to address
only the problems of Farm Credit System borrowers."
    However, Boren and other proponents of an across-the-board
interest rate or principal buydown did not say how much the
broad approach would cost.
    But Neil Harl, professor of economics at Iowa State
University told the hearing the cost could be in the range of
3.5 billion dlrs annually.
    By trying to draw into the farm credit rescue package all
farm borrowers, Boren and other Senators appeared to be
reacting to pressure from private lenders and their borrowers,
who fear they will be put at a competitive disadvantage by the
government rescue of the farm credit system and its borrowers.
    The farm credit system is the nation's largest lender to
agriculture with 39 pct of all farm real estate loans, but
private lenders account for nearly a quarter of loans on
farmland and 34 pct of farm operating loans, official figures
show.
    The American Bankers Association, in testimony to the
hearing, warned the farm credit rescue should not be structured
to favor the system over other lenders.
    As one way to meet the concern of private lenders, several
Senators, the farm credit system, and farm organizations
endorsed creation of a secondary market on farm real estate
loans, called "aggie mae", which is sought by private lenders.
    "We are also exploring the possibility of including in the
farm credit bill, the establishment of a secondary market for
agricultural loans that would be available to all lenders,"
Sen. Boren said.

the previously announced sale of all shares of wholly owned
Smoky River Coal Ltd and certain related assets to Smoky River
Holdings Ltd for a nominal cash consideration.
    McIntyre did not specify the cash amount of the sale.
    Smoky River Holdings is an Alberta company controlled by
Michael Henson, former president and chief executive of
McIntyre, the company said.
    McIntyre said it retained an unspecified royalty interest
in Smoky River Coal based on net operating cash flows from the
company's coal properties.
    McIntyre also said it provided a three mln dlr last
recourse letter of credit to the Alberta government for Smoky
River Coal's reclamation obligations.
    The credit letter expires either when Smoky River completes
three mln dlrs of reclaiming activities or December 31, 1992,
which ever occurs first.
    McIntyre said it also remains contingently liable for
certain obligations now totalling about seven mln dlrs, which
will reduce over time as Smoky River continues to operate.
    McIntyre's principal asset continues to be its 14 pct
interest in Falconbridge Ltd &lt;FALCF>.

<BODY>Shareholders of PHLCORP Inc, formerly
Baldwin-United Corp, nominated Leucadia National Corp's slate
of directors and adopted a proposal to reincorporate the
company in Pennsylvania, according to PHLCORP's secretary and
general counsel Bob Beber.
    Elected to the board were Leucadia Chairman Ian Cumming,
Leucadia President Joseph Steinberg, James Kimball and Michael
Lynch.
    PHLCORP previously said the planned reincorporation to
Pennsylvania from Delaware results in certain limited
restrictions on the transfer of company's shares, which are
intended to minimize the likelihood of loss of significant tax
benefits.
    PHLCORP earlier said that on November 14, 1986, Leucadia
acquired claims in Baldwin-United's bankruptcy proceedings
entitling it to about 39 pct of the outstanding common of
PHLCORP. Cumming and Steinberg were elected to the board in
November.
    Leucadia's candidates were the only nominated for the
board. PHLCORP had said if the candidates did not win
shareholder approval at the meeting in Philadelphia today, the
former directors would continue in office.
    PHLCORP has been managed by Palmieri Co, which was retained
to assume management control of the company by Baldwin's former
board of directors in May, 1983.
    Leucadia had previously said if its directors won approval,
the agreement with Palmieri would be terminated and Cumming and
Steinberg would step in as chairman and president,
respectively.
PHLCORP will merge into a newly formed Pennsylvania company.
Shares will be exchanged on a one-for-one basis.

<BODY>Top executives with Tenneco Corp &lt;TGT>
and Sabine Corp &lt;SAB> said they expected world oil prices to
gradually increase over the next two years as U.S. reliance on
imports of oil from the Middle East grows.
     "I believe we have bottomed out and can look forward to a
trend of gradually increasing prices," C.W. Nance, president of
Tenneco Oil Exploration and Production, told a meeting of the
Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association.
     Nance predicted that by 1990, the Organization of
Producing and Exporting Countries would be producing at the
rate of 80 pct of capacity.
    The gain will come largely through increased imports to the
United States, he said.
    "They will be able to raise the price again but I do not
think they will raise it as much as they did in 1979," Nance
said. He did not say how much of a price hike he expected.
     Andrew Shoup, chairman of Dallas-based Sabine, predicted
that world oil prices would increase from a range of 15 to 20
dlrs a barrel in 1987 to a range of 17 to 22 dlrs a barrel in
1988. Natural gas prices, Shoup said, should similarly climb
from a range of 1.30 to 1.70 dlrs per mcf this year to between
1.50 and 1.90 dlrs per mcf in 1988.
     "Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct in
increased demand," Shoup said, referring to the gas industry's
outlook for 1987. Repeal of the Fuel Use Act, a federal law
prohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plants
and utilities, could increase demand for gas by as much as 15
pct, he said.
     Tenneco's Nance also said that some U.S. cities may
experience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies next
winter because of the industry's reduced deliverability.
     Tenneco's gas deliverability, for example, dropped by 20
pct during 1986, he said.
     "This does not mean the gas bubble is gone," Nance said.
"We believe gas prices have bottomed out. The real question is
how broad the valley is -- is it one year, two years or three
years before we start to climb out?"
      J.C. Walter of &lt;Walter Oil and Gas Corp>, said the recent
improvement in oil prices was not enough for independent
producers to begin new onshore drilling projects.
     "If crude oil stays below 20 dlrs a barrel and 1.50 dlr
per mcf for natural gas prevails, the prospects for onshore
exploration at deeper depths in the Texas Gulf Coast by
independents in the 1990s are pretty dismal," Walter said.
     He suggested that some independents may instead turn to
exploration in shallow federal offshore leases. Farm-out
agreements, cheap rig rates and less competition have held
finding costs in those areas to five or six dlrs a barrel,
Walter said.

the government's fiscal 1988 budget would cut U.S. defense
spending authority by more than 25 billion dlrs from President
Reagan's request, resulting in a real reduction of military
spending authority for the third year in a row.
    While the plan would allow actual 1988 defense spending to
rise by 5.6 billion dlrs, domestic spending would be increased
by a disprportionate 42.7 billion dlrs, he said.
    Miller also criticized the Chiles plan's call for a 13.6

<BODY>The Soviet economy has grown at an
increased rate under Mikhail Gorbachev's leadership, but his
goals may be too ambitious, according to a report from U.S.
intelligence agencies.
    The report was prepared jointly by the Central Intelligence
Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency for the
Congressional Joint Economic committee, which released it.
    It said the Soviet economy grew by 4.2 pct in 1986,
Gorbachev's first full year in power, twice the average rate of
growth over the previous 10 years.
    Gorbachev's policies to improve worker attitudes, remove
incompetent officials, reduce corruption and alcoholism and
modernize the country's industrial equipment accounted for some
of the gains, the report said.
    "Although many of the specific policies Gorbachev has
adopted are not new, the intensity Gorbachev has brought to his
efforts and his apparent commitment to finding long-term
solutions are attributes that his immediate predecessors
lacked. Nonetheless, Gorbachev's program appears too ambitious
on a number of counts," the report said.
    Earlier this week, two U.S. experts on the Soviet Union
said Gorbachev was likely to be ousted in three to four years
if he continues his reform policies.
    "I don't think he can last four years," Marshall Goldman of
Harvard University told a Congressional hearing. "He's moving so
fast, he's stepping on so many toes."
    A similar comment came from Peter Reddaway of the
Smithsonian Institution's Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian
studies.
    The economic report said meeting targets for commodity
output would require unrealistic gains in productivity and
industrial output targets appear too high to allow time to
install more advanced equipment.
    None of Gorbachev's proposals would change the system of
economic incentives that has discouraged innovation and
technological change, the report added.
    "The first significant resistance to specific policies,
although not overall goals, surfaced (in 1986) in both the
massive government and party bureaucracy, particularly among
enterprise managers who complained that they were being asked
to carry out conflicting goals -- such as to raise quality
standards and output targets simultaneously," the report said.
    The CIA-DIA report predicted two to three pct growth in the
Soviet economy over the next several years. It said the Soviet
Union trailed the U.S. by seven to 12 years in advanced
manufacturing technologies, such as computers and
microprocessors.

<BODY>Great American Corp said
preliminary findings by regulatory examiners of its AMBANK
subsidiary will result in a first quarter charge of 14.1 mln
dlrs and a writedown of 1.4 mln dlrs.
    The charge will be made against the allowance for possible
loan losses, and the writedown is of other real estate.
    Great American said the examiners were conducting a regular
examination and a final report is not expected for several
weeks. Management intends to include the charge and writedown
in response to the preliminary findings.
    Great American said regulatory authorities are not
requiring an adjustment of the previously reported financial
results for Great American for 1986.
    However, Great American has revised its previous estimates
of provisions for possible losses and has added 9.9 mln dlrs to
the allowance account as of December 31, 1986. It said it took
the action since the charge-offs will significantly deplete its
allowance for possible loan losses and the economic environment
does not show signs for significant improvement in the near
future.
    It said the additional provision increases the allowance to
26.4 mln dlrs, representing 6.63 pct of the outstanding loan
portfolio and 83.2 pct of non-performing loans at year-end.
    Great American said its revised net loss for the fourth
quarter is 14.1 mln dlrs, or 6.36 dlrs per share, compared to a
net loss of 2.4 mln dlrs or 1.06 dlrs per share the year
earlier.

<BODY>Senate Agriculture Committee
Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said Congress would consider
limiting the use of generic commodity certificates as a means
of cutting government spending.
     "I suspect that as we go into some of the budget debates
we're going to have on the floor, this is going to be part of
it," Leahy said, referring to proposals that the U.S.
Agriculture Department save money by substituting cash outlays
for payment-in-kind, or PIK, certificates in price and income
support programs.
     "I have a feeling that the PIK program, however the cost
is defined, is going to be one of the top number of areas that
people are going to be looking for savings," Leahy told a
hearing of the Senate Agriculture Committee.
     The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the
government could save 1.4 billion dlrs during fiscal years
1988-92 if it curbed the use of generic certificates by banning
so-called "PIK and roll" transactions.
     Several Democratic senators had harsh comments for generic
certificates.
     "We're trying to take care of a bad situation --
surpluses--by depressing the price. I don't see any benefits,"
said Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa). "I don't see any benefit in
driving their prices lower, lower, lower all the time."
     But Sen. Rudy Boschwitz said he supported use of
certificates. "By and large I'm favorably impressed by PIK
certificates. I feel they have been helpful," said Boschwitz.
     As expected, officials from the General Accounting Office
and the U.S. Agriculture Department indicated their estimates
of the cost of PIK certificates compared to cash outlays were
far apart.
     The General Accounting Office, GAO, told the committee
that PIK certificates increased total Commodity Credit Corp
outlays through 1987 by between 107 mln and 653 mln dlrs. GAO
said that increase was offset by commodity storage cost savings
of beween 169 mln and 253 mln dlrs.
     Pressed by the committee, GAO Senior Associate Director
Brian Crowley said government spending probably was about 450
mln dlrs above what it would have been had all program payments
been made in cash, not counting storage savings.
     Crowley also said he thought PIK certificates had lowered
the price of corn and boosted domestic consumption of corn.
     Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz told the
committee that the additional costs of using PIK certificates
and storage, handling and transportation costs "balance off
very closely."
     Amstutz said he estimated the net cost of using
certificates was about one pct higher than using only cash to
make program payments.
     William Bailey, USDA deputy administrator for program
planning, said there were "one hundred issues I find either
incorrect (in the GAO report), disagree with or where their
(GAO) facts are inconsistent with what's going on."
     Amstutz said GAO had not given USDA the option of
"providing input" into the preparation of their report "as they
frequently do."
     The USDA undersecretary also conceded that certificates
and marketing loans had the similar effect of "putting more
goods into the market," but that while the department supported
certificates, it would continue to oppose a marketing loan for
wheat and feedgrains because it would cost too much.

<BODY>Angola's U.S.-backed UNITA rebel
group has offered to reopen the Benguela railroad that runs
through UNITA-held territory and links landlocked Zaire and
Zambia to the Angolan port of Lobito.
    UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, in a statement made in his
Jamba headquarters in southern Angola and released by UNITA's 
Washington office, said he was prepared to guarantee safe
passage for non-military freight as a gesture of "peace and
reconciliation."
    Savimbi challenged the Cuban-backed Angolan government,
which controls the port, to match his offer and allow goods to
pass through. There was no immediate response from Luanda.
    UNITA has been fighting the Cuban-backed Angolan government
since 1976.
    The offer of a rail route to the Atlantic would help South
Africa's black neighbors reduce their economic dependence on
South Africa.
    The U.S. Congress is currently considering a proposal to
spend some 500 mln dlrs to build another railroad to help these
states become less dependent on South Africa.
    The Beira corridor runs through Mozambique to Tanzania's
Indian ocean ports but Savimbi suggested the Benguela route as
an alternative.
    "The Benguela route can safely open immediately," he said. "It
will provide the transportation our neighbors need, and it will
not cost the Americans the money they say it will cost to open
the Beira corridor."

<BODY>Federal Reserve data released today
indicate that there has been no policy change in recent weeks
and that none is likely at next week's Federal Open Market
Committee (FOMC) meeting, economists said.
    "The Fed continues to be accommodative in its provision of
reserves, indicating that there has been no policy shift since
the beginning of this year," said Harold Nathan, economist at
Wells Fargo Bank.
    "These numbers and other things suggest the FOMC will not
change policy," said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co.
    "The Fed is sitting fairly pretty now. There's no real
reason for it to change policy," said Joseph Liro of S.G.
Warburg and Co Inc.
    Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and does
not require immediate policy easing and the money aggregates
may well end March at the bottom of their target ranges.
    All of the economists agreed that the Fed's major concern
now is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week was
heavily supported by central banks. They said fear of hurting
the dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in lowering
interest rates further.
    Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line with
expectations and similar to the data for most of this year.
    The Fed said that banks' net free reserves averaged 603 mln
dlrs in the two-week statement period that ended on Wednesday
versus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period.
    In the single week to Wednesday, banks' borrowings at the
discount window, less extended credits, averaged 302 mln dlrs
compared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statement
period. Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to
6.14 pct from 6.08 pct.
    The Fed's failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesday
and Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the data
released today suggest it had no real need to add reserves.
    The Fed's absence may be explained by the lack of any
pressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire to
boost borrowings in the second week of the statement period to
meet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg.
    Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two-week
borrowings average of 300-325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actually
averaged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and that
was up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period.
    Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming for
two-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mln
dlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate of
around 6.10 pct.
    It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowings
target since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, said
Wells Fargo's Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead on
the funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to
6-1/4 pct band.
    Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve-adding need
are anticipated for the statement period that began today.

    Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to four
billion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liro
puts the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs.
    To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed to
add permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering to
buy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similar
coupon "pass" may be required later.
    There will be a greater demand for funds in this statement
period because it includes the close of the quarter. Further
upward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from window
dressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31.

<BODY>Substantial difficulties faced by the
U.S. farm credit system can be solved with a business-like
approach to the problems, a Farm Credit Admimistration official
said.
    Marvin R. Duncan, a member of the administration board,
said the farm credit system faces unprecedented difficulties in
its 70-year history.
    Addressing Chicago business and agricultural economists,
Duncan outlined three basic problems of the farm credit system.
Those include the high cost of its debt, the quality of its
assets, and the management of its credit delivery system.
    He said some of the system's debt carries interest rates as
high as 15.65 pct and will not mature until the year 2007.
    Of its 54.6 mln dlrs in assets, 24.1 pct are non-accrual,
high risk or already forfeited property, which led to losses in
1986 of 1.9 billion dlrs and in 1985 of 2.7 billion dlrs.
    Problems with credit delivery have been somewhat resolved,
he said.
    "The system is still plagued with duplication in layers of
management and decision-making, inadequate tailoring of credit
services to fit the emerging market, a large investment in
bricks and mortar, and a management and directorate more
insular to the marketplace than that of its competitors," he
said.
    He said solutions to the problems should -
 - provide assurances to farmers on borrowers stock and the
stability of the farm credit system.
 - maintain confidence of investors who buy system securities.
 - address the high cost of the system's existing debt.
 - enable the Farm Credit System Capital Corporation to carry
out its role as a workout bank.
    Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration,
said this week that the system may lose as much as 1.4 billion
dlrs this year, and another board member, Jim Billington, said
Congress should plan to spend at least 800 mln dlrs beginning
late this year to bail out the system.
    Duncan noted that the system has about 70 billion dlrs in
assets, serves about 800,000 individual borrowers and 3,000
cooperatives, and has 62.5 billion dlrs in securities
outstanding.
    "With a business-like solution to its problems, it can
continue that role for generations into the future," he said.

<BODY>The United States' emphasis on its
foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country's real
problem lies in its large federal budget deficit, the General
Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said.
     By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billion
dlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressure
which threatens the world trading system, it said in an annual
report.
    The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federal
budget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting government
spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt,
it said.
    GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pct
in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the
previous two years.
    GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and
instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current
account payments deficit -- higher private savings, lower
investment and a smaller federal budget deficit.
    Raising U.S. Trade barriers "would result in little or no
reduction in the current account deficit. It would, however,
increase inflation and reduce world trade," it said.
    "The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient
domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would
remain," the report said.
    GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year
because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West
European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a
low dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over Third
World debt management and looming protectionism.
    The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of
Japan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986.
    The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes
were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added.
    "Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced
as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not
borne out last year," the report said.
    GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the
U.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly
expanding money supply and low dollar.
    "Such a development could worsen the business climate by
increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, in
turn, would adversely affect world trade."
    But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the
United States, despite the dollar's depreciation which makes
foreign products more expensive.
    It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both human
and in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce the
goods and services sought from abroad.
    World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986,
about half of the rate of the previous year.
    Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct,
continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATT
said.
    Developing countries' exports declined significantly, while
their imports increased moderately, although full statistics
are not available yet, GATT said.
    The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations
were sharply lower, and only five of them (Chile, Colombia,
Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand) had higher exports.

<BODY>The White House Economic Policy
Council decided to recommend trade sanctions against Japan for
violations of the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement,
industry sources said.
    They would give no details, noting that the White House had
not commented on the decision. The administration has been
under pressure to retaliate.
    There was no immediate announcement on the council's
decision, but U.S. Officials said it was likely the senior
policy group's move on curbs reflected growing American
frustration over alleged unfair Japanese trade practices.
    U.S. Officials said President Reagan would probably act on
the recommendations in a day or so, after consulting with aides
on the foreign policy implications of retaliation.
    The officials said Reagan might delay retaliation for a
last try to persuade Japan to abide by the agreement reached
last July governing trade in semiconductors.
    Under a pact reached last July, Japan was to stop dumping
semiconductors in world markets and to open its own market to
U.S.-made semiconductors.
    In return, the U.S. Agreed to hold up imposing anti-dumping
duties on Japanese semiconductor shipments.
    The United States said that dumping has stopped in the U.S.
Market but has continued in third countries, and that the
Japanese market remains closed.
    The pressure on Reagan to retaliate included a unanimous
call by the Senate last week to impose penalties on Japanese
high technology products containing semiconductors.
    A call for retaliation also came from the semiconductor
industry and from its chief trade union.
    U.S. Officials said the most likely move against Japan
would involve duties on semiconductor-based goods, such as

<BODY>India is searching for non-communist
countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and
conserve foreign exchange.
    Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and
electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are
all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,
chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.
    Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in
1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading
Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).
    "The two state trading corporations are free to use their
buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian
exports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that
private firms are excluded from countertrading.
    One trade source said India has targetted countries that
depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign
imports.
    However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part
of India's total trading and are likely to account for less
than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade
during the nine months ended December, the sources said.
    Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65
billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,
against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.
    However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern
Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.
    Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of
agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude
oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,
against three billion in 1985/86.
    Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help
narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still
insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,
Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.
    The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96
billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion
in the current fiscal year.
    But the push to include non-communist countries in
countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow
growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,
shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.
    One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting
countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made
discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot
officially support bartering.
    The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore
exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.
    "MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that
preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind
for goods and services sold to India," a trade official said,
adding that the policy remains flexible.
    "We also take into account other factors such as prices at
which the goods and services are offered to India," the trade
official said.
    Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign
companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs
and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance
if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade
sources said.
    Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean
firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln
dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.
    In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy
Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pct
sought by New Delhi, the trade official said.
    "We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest,"
he added.
    Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign
currency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol to
buy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in
exchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars.
    But despite India's new drive, countertrade has some
inherent problems, they added.
    "It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that
the trade should always be balanced," one trade source said. "The
other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy
commodities which the other party wants."
    Another added, "Barter is also restrictive. We look upon it
as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of
payments difficulty.
    "This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India.
It does not even figure in the country's foreign trade policy."

    The date for the government to announce its package, based
on the LDP's suggested measures, is not yet known but it may be
before the fiscal 1987 budget passes the Parliament around late
May, the officials said.
    The government has said in the past the package should come
after the passage of the budget.
    But calls have grown at home and abroad for the government
to announce it earlier as budget debates have been stalled by
an opposition boycott of parliamentary business in protest at a
planned five pct sales tax.
    EPA chief Tetsuo Kondo told a press conference he sees a
need to work on the economic plan early although the
government's stance on the date for the plan remains the same,
an EPA spokesman said.
    Projected measures include promoting house construction,
infrastructure and urban development, he quoted Kondo as
saying.
    Under last month's Paris currency agreement, Japan promised
to work out a comprehensive economic plan to stimulate domestic
demand, increase imports and so help reduce its huge trade
surplus.
    The government announced today Nakasone will visit
Washington on April 29 for a week to discuss bilateral issues,
including the trade imbalance, with President Reagan and other
officials.

<BODY>The &lt;British Petroleum Co of
Australia Ltd> reported a 16.15 mln dlr net loss for 1986
against a 73.38 mln dlr profit in 1985 after sales fell to 2.27
billion dlrs from 2.94 billion.
    The British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> unit attributed the
deficit to stock losses arising from the drop in crude prices
in the first half, when it made a 119.93 mln dlr loss.
    It said government compensation, in the form of subsidies
to refiners to partially cover stock losses, together with
improved crude prices in the second half, enabled the group's
oil business to make a modest pre-tax profit.
    BP Australia said it had not recommended a dividend.
    Commenting on the year's performance, the company said it
suspended operations at the 60 pct-owned Agnew Nickel mine
because of losses sustained from declining nickel prices.
    The results also included an 11.3 mln dlr extraordinary
writedown on the value of the laid-up oil exploration drillship
Regional Endeavour.
    BP Australia said it had sold its 33-1/3 stake in chemical
maker &lt;CSBP and Farmers Ltd> yielding an extraordinary profit
of 18.9 mln dlrs and expected to finalise the sale of the 80
pct-owned &lt;Kwinana Nitrogen Co> in the first half of 1987.

    Around 200 corporations satisfy financial standards set by
securities houses for non-collateral straight bond issues,

    Most eligible firms would have to set up special reserves

    The legal status of yen CP would be the same as yen
commercial bills and it would be placed by an intermediary bank

    The minimum issue unit will be 100 mln yen, and maturities
will be from 30 days and six months, they said.

<BODY>Four major Japanese steelmakers plan to
form a seamless pipe export cartel for markets other than the
U.S. And the European Community for a year from April to keep
prices above output costs, company officials involved said.
    The companies are Nippon steel Corp &lt;NSTC.T>, Sumitomo
Metal Industries Ltd &lt;SMIT.T>, Nippon Kokan KK &lt;NKKT.T> and
Kawasaki Steel Corp &lt;KAWS.T>, which together account for some
95 pct of Japan's total seamless pipe exports.
    The firms will apply to form the cartel to the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry today and approval is expected
later this month, the officials said.
    Under the plan, the four companies will set floor prices
for exports as prices have fallen sharply due to the yen's
appreciation against the dollar, reduced world demand caused by
lower oil prices and excess domestic capacity which resulted in
price-cutting competition, the officials said.
    In calendar 1986, seamless pipe exports fell to 2.34 mln
tonnes from 2.99 mln in 1985 and 3.12 mln in 1981.
    The officials declined to give any idea of floor prices,
saying it depends partly on volume, but industry sources
estimate average export prices would rise by around 20 pct to
some 800 dlrs a tonne.

<BODY>The president of Japan's biggest high
technology firm, NEC Corp &lt;NIPN.T>, is anything but worried,
despite growing anti-Japanese protectionism, a soaring yen, and
a stagnant world electronics market.
    "The company's structure was developed by looking ahead,"
Tadahiro Sekimoto told Reuters in an interview.
    "We assumed the era of a strong yen, trade friction and
globalisation would arrive, and we moved ahead on that basis.
There's no need to change our strategy now."
    However, the world's largest manufacturer of microchips,
the tiny silicon wafers which are the brains of most high
technology products, knows it must keep looking ahead if it is
to survive.
    Hoping to build on existing strengths, NEC is now turning
its focus on home electronics, an area of past weakness,
Sekimoto said.
    NEC wants to follow its corporate slogan "C and C" (Computers
and Communications) to create high level home electronics that
go beyond mere televisions and video tape recorders, Sekimoto
said.
    Home electronics accounted for only eight pct of NEC's
total 2,334.67 billion yen sales on a consolidated basis in the
year ended March 31, 1986.
    Industry analysts say NEC is wise to target what will be a
major growth market in the future, but some warn the company
faces some stiff competition.
    "This is where the market is going to be for a long time --
in products that combine personal computers, video display and
telecommunications networks," said Salomon Brothers (Asia) Ltd
analyst Carole Ryavec. "But Matsushita (Electric Industrial Co
Ltd) may be there first."
    But Sekimoto argues that NEC's overall strengths will carry
the day.
    "Many companies are in the top 10 in computers or microchips
or telecommunications, but none is in the top 10 in all three.
NEC is unique in that respect," he said.
    To help its already high rankings, NEC will further
increase the high level of offshore production which makes it
one of the most multinational of Japan's electronics firms.
    The company will increase offshore output of all goods it
sells overseas to 50 pct from a current 25 pct over the next
several years, Sekimoto said.
    But the firm plans to go it alone in expanding overseas,
despite moving last year to become joint owner, along with
France's Cie des Machines Bull &lt;BULP.P>, of U.S. Firm Honeywell
Inc's &lt;HON> Information Systems unit.
    "We hope to increase our share in the U.S. Market through
the Honeywell tie-up. But our basic strategy is to take an
independent and autonomous route," said Sekimoto.
    The company also plans to maintain its independent line by
continuing to make computers which are not compatible with
those of International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM>, he said.
    "Among the Japanese competitors, only NEC hasn't been caught
in software copyright disputes with IBM and our profits and
market share have gradually expanded," Sekimoto said.
    Once new ways of linking non-compatible computers are
perfected, IBM compatibility will be irrelevant. "What will
matter is the best hardware, the best software and the best
ability to meet customers needs," Sekimoto said.
    In fact, NEC, which has over half of Japan's personal
computer market, may go to court to stop competitors selling
cheaper machines which can run NEC software but infringe
copyright on its operating system, an NEC spokesman said.
    While industry analysts give NEC high marks for looking
ahead, they note that it failed in forecasting microchip
demand. Like other Japanese chipmakers, the firm was left with
serious excess capacity when lean years followed the boom
times.
    But after two years of cutbacks in capital investment in
the sector, Sekimoto thinks the time has come to boost spending
again, if only slightly.
    "We're not going to increase production. But we are going to
invest in new product development and upgrade existing plant,"
he said.
    Despite NEC's admitted strengths, analysts note the company
faces tough times due to stagnant markets.
    "NEC has excellent worldwide capacity and technology, but
they are caught in a downturn which may last a long time," said
Salamon's Ryavec.
    The company forecasts such troubles will slash parent net
profits to 30 billion yen in the year ending March 31, 1987,
down 43 pct from the previous year, although sales are expected
to rise eight pct to 2,130 billion yen.
    Profits will improve only slightly next year, rising to 38
billion yen on sales of 2,350 billion, it said.

<BODY>The government adopted an 8,829 billion
yen stop-gap budget for fiscal 1987 starting April 1 to
compensate for the delay in the passage through the Parliament
of the full 1987/88 budget.
    The provisional budget includes 1,862 billion yen in public
works spending to help stimulate the economy and meet overseas
demand for Japan to import more and reduce its huge trade
surplus, officials said.
    They said the stop-gap budget will be in effect for 50 days
through May 20 and is the largest ever.
    The budget includes 1,580 billion yen in new government
bond issues.
    Officials said the spending on public works accounts for
about two-sevenths of the 6,017 billion yen in public works
outlay set aside in the pending formal 1987/88 budget.
    The planned full budget totals 54,101 billion yen.
    The government had to work out the stop-gap budget because
budget debates have been delayed by an opposition boycott of
Parliamentary business in protest against a planned five pct
sales tax.

<BODY>Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd
of 20 H.K. Cents each for every ordinary share of par value two
dlrs.
    A company statement said the firm expects to pay a total
1987 dividend of four cents per "B" share, while the "A" share
dividend will be maintained at last year's level of 40 cents a
share.
    Jardine Matheson announced earlier a 205 pct jump in 1986
net profits to 479 mln dlrs from 157 mln in 1985.
    Shareholders' funds increased to 5.02 billion dlrs from
4.77 billion in 1985, the statement said.
    It quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying Jardine Matheson
achieved the good performance through satisfactory results in
most sections, especially Hong Kong Land Co Ltd &lt;HKLD.HKG>,
Jardine Fleming Co Ltd, and its business in Japan.
    He said the group's stake of about 35 pct in Hong Kong
Land, which will be lowered to 26 pct after the completion of a
reorganisation, is "a long term investment and now stands at a
level which causes us no financial strain or problems of asset
imbalance."
    Keswick said the issue of new "B" shares will give the group
"the flexibility in the future to issue ordinary shares for
expansion without jeopardising the shareholding stability which
has been brought about through the group's recent
restructuring."
    He said the new issue is pending approval from both the
firm's shareholders and warrant holders, adding an appropriate
adjustment will be made to the warrant exercise price.
    The Jardine group has nearly completed its reorganisation,
with Jardine Matheson transferring its control of Hk Land to
the new unit &lt;Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd>.
    Jardine Strategic will also hold majority stakes in the two
companies spun off from Hk Land -- &lt;Mandarin Oriental
International Ltd> and &lt;Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd>
-- plus cross holdings with Jardine Matheson.
    Jardine Matheson, which had debts of about 2.7 billion dlrs
last year, will become debt free after the restructuring.
    "A positive cash flow from operations and disposals,
continuing into 1987, has transformed our balance sheet,"
Keswick said. He noted the firm last year sold interests in
airfreight operations, Australian properties and trucking
business, and its remaining U.S. Oil and gas activities.
    Jardine Matheson decided to make a provision against its
general trading business in the Middle East in view of the
continuing weakness of oil prices, Keswick said. But he said
the operations would be profitable in the longer term.
    He said the firm's function "has evolved into one primarily
of strategy, structure and financial and personnel policy."
    He said Jardine Matheson will reduce the size of the board
of directors but will simultaneously create a new Pacific
regional board. He gave no further details of the change.
    Jardine Matheson shares rose 20 cents to 24.90 dlrs at
midday on the Hong Kong stock market. In early trading it had
fallen to 24.30 dlrs because of rumours yesterday that the firm
planned a rights issue.

said it expects a strong full year result, helped by sigificant
investment allowance credits in the fourth quarter, but net
will fall short of the record 988.2 mln dlrs earned in 1985/86
ended May 31.
    The group earlier reported its net earnings dropped to
603.0 mln dlrs in the first three quarters ended February 28
from 813.0 mln a year earlier.
    Third quarter net fell to 206.0 mln dlrs from 238.6 mln a
year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter ended November
31, BHP said in a statement.
    Earnings in the first nine months were at the lower end of
share analysts' forecasts yesterday of a range of 600 mln to
620 mln dlrs.
    BHP held its annual dividend unchanged at 37.5 cents after
declaring a steady final dividend of 20 cents and announced a
one-for-five bonus issue to shareholders registered May 1.
    The bonus is being made from reserves which will not
qualify for tax-free distribution after the introduction of
dividend imputation next July 1.
    The bonus shares will not rank for the final dividend, BHP
said.
    BHP said it should not be expected that the present rate of
dividend will be maintained on the increased capital.
    The level of future dividends will be influenced by the
implications of the proposed dividend imputation legislation,
it said.
    As previously reported, dividends will become tax-free in
shareholders' hands provided they are paid out of profits that
have borne the full 49 pct company tax rate.
    BHP, which confined comment to the third quarter, said
petroleum net earnings dropped to 98.8 mln dlrs from 139.6 mln
a year earlier, and steel profit to 27.0 mln from 48.8 mln.
    BHP said the petroleum division earnings fall reflected
generally lower oil prices and sales volumes from Bass Strait
while the steel decline was due to a five pct fall in domestic
sales and higher costs associated with the commissioning of new
plant and some operational difficulties.
    The rise in third quarter minerals net to 95.7 mln dlrs
from 81.5 mln a year earlier largely reflected the increase in
ownership of the Mt Newman iron ore project, it said.
    The 60.7 mln dlr extraordinary gain, all in the third term,
reflected a 240.7 mln profit on the sale of &lt;Blue Circle
Southern Cement Ltd> offset by a U.S. Oil acreage writedown.

    Last week the Bank offered 400 mln dlrs of 13-week notes

<BODY>The U.S. Has approved the sale of a
U.S.-made supercomputer to India while rejecting its request
for a more powerful model, the New York Times reported.
    India wanted to buy a powerful supercomputer, such as the
Cray X-MP with two processors running in tandem, but the Times
said U.S. Officials offered a choice of machines with a single
processor, several generations behind the Cray X-MP.
    The paper, citing unnamed U.S. Officials, said the Indian
government was told of the decision last week, but has so far
given no formal indication that it is interested in the type
offered.
    India had asked the U.S. For an modern supercomputer which
it indicated would be used for scientific purposes, notably
sophisticated weather forecasting.
    However, India's close ties with the Soviet Union remains
the main reason why the U.S. Has restricted the sale of its
state-of-the-art computer technology to India, the Times said.
    U.S. Defence officials are particulalry concerned the
Soviet Union could gain access to the supercomputer and use it
to decipher high-level U.S. Codes, while others say the
computer could be very useful in designing nuclear weapons.

<BODY>Philippine sugar production in the
1987/88 crop year ending August has been set at 1.6 mln tonnes,
up from a provisional 1.3 mln tonnes this year, Sugar
Regulatory Administration (SRA) chairman Arsenio Yulo said.
    Yulo told Reuters a survey during the current milling
season, which ends next month, showed the 1986/87 estimate
would almost certainly be met.
    He said at least 1.2 mln tonnes of the 1987/88 crop would
be earmarked for domestic consumption.
    Yulo said about 130,000 tonnes would be set aside for the
U.S. Sugar quota, 150,000 tonnes for strategic reserves and
50,000 tonnes would be sold on the world market.
    He said if the government approved a long-standing SRA
recommendation to manufacture ethanol, the project would take
up another 150,000 tonnes, slightly raising the target.
    "The government, for its own reasons, has been delaying
approval of the project, but we expect it to come through by
July," Yulo said.
    Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline, cutting the oil
import bill by about 300 mln pesos.
    Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready to
start manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved.
    The ethanol project would result in employment for about
100,000 people, sharply reducing those thrown out of work by
depressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry.
    Production quotas, set for the first time in 1987/88, had
been submitted to President Corazon Aquino.
    "I think the President would rather wait till the new
Congress convenes after the May elections," he said. "But there
is really no need for such quotas. We are right now producing
just slightly over our own consumption level."
    "The producers have never enjoyed such high prices," Yulo
said, adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesos
per picul, up from 190 pesos last August.
    Yulo said prices were driven up because of speculation
following the SRA's bid to control production.
    "We are no longer concerned so much with the world market,"
he said, adding producers in the Negros region had learned from
their mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming and
cloth production.
    He said diversification into products other than ethanol
was also possible within the sugar industry.
    "The Brazilians long ago learnt their lessons," Yulo said.
"They have 300 sugar mills, compared with our 41, but they
relocated many of them and diversified production. We want to
call this a 'sugarcane industry' instead of the sugar industry."
    He said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock, used
for thatching roofs, or used in room panelling.
    "When you cut sugarcane you don't even have to produce
sugar," he said.
    Yulo said the Philippines was lobbying for a renewal of the
International Sugar Agreement, which expired in 1984.
    "As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new
agreement which would revive world prices," Yulo said.
    "If there is no agreement world prices will always be
depressed, particularly because the European Community is
subsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets."
    He said current world prices, holding steady at about 7.60
cents per pound, were uneconomical for the Philippines, where
production costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound.
    "If the price holds steady for a while at 7.60 cents I
expect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the end
of this year," he said.
    Yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by
1990, with world consumption outstripping production.
    He said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachments
from artificial sweeteners and high-fructose corn syrup.
    "But we are not happy with the Reagan Administration," he
said. "Since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to the
U.S. In 1982, when they restored the quota system, they cut
ours in half without any justification."
    Manila was keenly watching Washington's moves to cut
domestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents.
    The U.S. Agriculture Department last December slashed its
12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the Philippines to
143,780 short tons from 231,660 short tons in 1986.
    Yulo said despite next year's increased production target,
some Philippine mills were expected to shut down.
    "At least four of the 41 mills were not working during the
1986/87 season," he said. "We expect two or three more to follow
suit during the next season."

<BODY>Japan has sought to assure the U.S. It is
not trying to keep foreign equity in a new Japanese
international telecommunications company below the legal limit
of 33 pct, a Post and Telecommunications ministry official
said.
    In a letter sent yesterday, Postal Minister Shunjiro
Karasawa told U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige that the
ministry does not object to foreign participation by those U.S.
Firms that have expressed interest.
    But it does oppose any foreign international
telecommunications carrier having a management role, he said.
    The move appears to be an effort to dampen U.S. Opposition
to the planned merger of two rival firms seeking to compete
with the current monopoly &lt;Kokusai Denwa Denshin Co Ltd>, and
to reduce the share held in any KDD rival by U.K.'s Cable and
Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L>, industry analysts and diplomats said.
    One of the rival firms, &lt;International Telecom Japan Inc>
(ITJ) has offered a stake in the company to eight U.S. Firms
including General Electric Co &lt;GE>, Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and
Citibank NA &lt;CCI), and two European companies, ITJ president
Nobuo Ito said yesterday.
    Cable and Wireless holds a 20 pct share in a second
potential KDD rival, &lt;International Digital Communications
Planning Inc>, along with &lt;C Itoh and Co>. Merrill Lynch and Co
Inc &lt;MER> and Pacific Telesis International Inc &lt;PAC>, both of
the U.S., Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively.
    The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has urged the
merger of the two firms because it says the market can only
support a single KDD competitor.
    It has also rejected management participation by an
international common carrier, such as Cable and Wireless,
arguing no international precedent for such a stake exists.
    Cable and Wireless Director of Corporate Strategy, Jonathan
Solomon, yesterday again told ministry officials he opposes a
merger proposal that would limit Cable and Wireless' share to
less than three pct and total foreign participation to about 20
pct, the ministry official said.
    Channeling the U.S. Firms into a single merged competitor
would most probably result in diluting Cable and Wireless'
share, industry analysts said.
    "Eventually the ministry will get what it wants -- one
combined competitor," Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd analyst
Darrell Whitten said.
    "Political ... Leverage may get the total foreign share up
to a certain amount, but you won't find any one company with an
extraordinarily large holding," Whitten said.
    Western diplomatic sources were more blunt.
    "They (the ministry) don't want to see Cable and Wireless
with a reasonable share and they think of all sorts of
strategies to reduce that share," one said.
    Fumio Watanabe, a senior Keidanren (a leading business
organization) official who has been trying to arrange the
merger, will present a new outline of his proposal on Thursday,
the ministry official said.

expected to invest close to 100 mln dlrs on acquisitions in
building materials both in Australia and offshore.
    One analyst, who asked not to be named, said about 25 pct
of Delhi could be offered to CSR shareholders in an arrangement
which would preserve the tax position of the Cooper Basin oil
and gas producer, which is held in a trust.
    CSR had now finished paying for Delhi, after last year
writing down large foreign exchange losses on loans to buy the
company and selling such investments as its share of the Mount
Newman iron ore project, the analyst said.
    CSR had restructured its management in recent months and
was redirecting its efforts into industrial divisions from its
resources business, analysts told Reuters. It could be expected
to also float its coal interests, they said.
    The company earlier this month said it would sell its five
Sydney head office buildings.
    Stuart McKibbin of Melbourne broker &lt;A.C. Goode and Co Ltd>
said CSR had till now been overlooked by many of the offshore
investors now heavily buying Australian gold and resource
stocks. That climate could prove an ideal time to float the CSR
petroleum division, he said.

said economic information company Data Resources Europe Inc
(DRI).
    Michel Girardin, DRI Europe's senior economist, said at a
conference that Italian GDP growth this year "will be mainly
driven by consumption and especially investment."
    Girardin said the driving force behind GDP growth next year
will shift from domestic demand to exports as a result of
expected depreciation of the lira against the major currencies.
    Italy's budget ministry said yesterday that GDP rose 2.7
pct in real terms in 1986.
    DRI forecast that inflation, which was an average 6.3 pct
in 1986, will be under five pct this year and that interest
rates should drop two pct.
    Girardin said the lira is expected to appreciate 14 pct
against the dollar this year following last year's 22 pct
appreciation. An expected German mark appreciation against the
dollar means that the lira should lose about six pct of its
value relative to the German currency, he said.

<BODY>Japan today announced another mammoth
monthly trade surplus that economists said would be sure to
intensify already mounting pressure on the country for action.
    "The world has every reason to be furious with Japan for not
moving more quickly," Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd economist
Eric Rasmussen said.
    The Finance Ministry said today that the trade surplus
soared to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion in
January and 4.77 billion a year ago.
    The current account surplus, which includes trade in
services as well as goods, climbed to 7.38 billion dlrs last
month from 4.95 billion in January and 3.89 billion a year ago.
    After being adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, the figures
look a bit better, but not much. On that basis, the trade
surplus declined slightly in February to 9.16 billion dlrs from
a record 9.58 billion in January.
    "In the medium term we expect this modest improvement to
continue but the pace of progress may be too slow to ward off
further protectionism or further yen strength," said William
Stirling, economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.
    A strong yen would make Japanese goods more expensive on
world markets while making imports into the country cheaper.
    "On a seasonally adjusted basis, we appear to be making some
progress on getting exports down," Jardine's Rasmussen said.
    But imports do not seem to be picking up much because the
Japanese economy remains sluggish, he said.
    Finance Ministry officials blamed last month's slower
import growth on a decline in oil imports as refiners worked
off stocks they had built up in January.
    The officials took comfort from a decline in the volume of
exports last month, after an unexpected year-on-year increase
in January.
    This means the effects of the two-year rise of the yen
against the U.S. Dollar are finally beginning to have an impact
on exports, they said.
    But economists warned that may not be soon enough for
Japan's trading partners.

<BODY>Recent slackness on Dutch capital
markets has led some bankers to question the Central Bank's
policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the West German mark
and to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy.
    While agreeing with the Bank's commitment to defend the
guilder strongly, some bankers want the Bank to make more use
of the range within which the guilder and the mark can
fluctuate against each other in the European Monetary System
(EMS).
    Roelof Nelissen, chairman of Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV
(Amro) said the Central Bank's policy was overcautious.
    "I would like to suggest that the Bank use more freely the
range given to the guilder in the EMS," Nelissen said at the
presentation of Amro's 1986 annual report last week.
    Within the EMS, the mark is allowed to fluctuate against
the guilder between 110.1675 and 115.235 guilders per 100.
    The Central Bank maintains a stricter policy and tries to
keep the mark below the 113.00 guilders per 100. It regards a
stable exchange rate as its main target, using interest rate
policies to influence the exchange rate.
    The preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate
aims goes almost undisputed in the Netherlands.
    Critics say the Bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short.
    Rabobank Nederland said in its latest economic bulletin: "By
maintaining the 113.00 limit, the Central Bank raises the
expectation it will always intervene above that level. If it
suddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to
obtain."
    Amro's Nelissen said relatively small changes in interest
rates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of
securities business and sharp fluctuations on the Dutch capital
market. Large interest rate changes were often needed to bring
about small changes in the guilder/mark exchange rate, he
added.
    Unlike Amro, Algemene Bank Nederland NV (ABN) says this is
a price the Dutch have to pay. It fully agrees with the Central
Bank's policy, director-general Julien Geertsema told Reuters,
noting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with
the mark in the EMS hurt confidence in the Dutch currency.
    "It is a pity we need such a wide interest rate difference
between West Germany to maintain the exchange rate," he added.
    Interest rate differentials between West Germany and the
Netherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows
between the two countries, as the economic performance of the
two does not differ much, economists said.
    Data on 1986 capital flows between West Germany and the
Netherlands have not yet been released, but in 1985 they
accounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two
countries, put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the
Dutch-German Chamber of Commerce earlier this month.
    Economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest
and exchange rates.
    West Germany is the Netherlands' largest single trading
partner, taking 28 pct of Dutch exports and providing 26 pct of
imports in the last quarter of 1986, Central Bureau of
Statistics figures show.
    At the moment, the rates for three month euromark deposits
trade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have a
rate of around 5-7/16 pct.
    Amro bank argues that the Dutch real interest rate will
even rise further because of expectations of deflation here in
1987, contrasting with slight inflation in West Germany.
    In the Netherlands, the cost of living is expected to
decrease by 1.5 pct at a GNP growth rate of two pct, the Dutch
Central Planning Agency said in its 1987 forecast last month.
German GNP is seen rising by two to 2.5 pct, but with inflation
between zero and 1.0 pct, according to most German forecasts.
    But despite this upward push on real Dutch rates, money
dealers do not expect the Central Bank to cut official rates
independently without prior moves by the Bundesbank.
    Following the West German interest rate cuts on January 22,
the Dutch Central Bank did not lower its rates but set a 0.5
pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit
surcharge. Most traders were surprised by this move as they had
expected the Bank to follow suit unconditionally, they said.
    The Bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact
on the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted.
    While not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its
policies, the Central Bank keeps its grip firm and the range
narrow.
    "The European Monetary System is not only a relationship
between the guilder and the mark. Many times widening of the
margin between the two would implicate we have to buy or sell
large amounts of a third currency," Central Bank vice-director
Jan-Hendrik Du Marchie Sarvaas said.
    "If we allowed the guilder to become a little cheaper, the
markets would start to believe it was weak. We don't want that.
We want to make clear that the guilder is just as strong as the
mark," he said.

<BODY>The German auction system of shares
trading, retaining the business floor, can develop in parallel
to off-floor computer trading introduced in London in the "Big
Bang," Frankfurt stock exchange president Michael Hauck said.
    Hauck told a conference that it was unclear if the
Frankfurt floor would become superfluous. The Frankfurt
exchange did 55 pct of all German securities trading and was
investing 86 mln marks in renovating its building. A
screen-delivered in-house quotation system would soon be in
place too.
    The nature of the auction system limited how far trading
hours could be extended from the present two-hour session.
    Other practical problems inhibited the German ability to
follow London's moves. Official brokers, who set the prices,
were under the control of the Finance Ministry. This meant
transfer of securities control to an independent body, if
desired, would need legislative changes, Hauck said.
    "Shorting" stocks in Germany was also prohibited by the rules
for pension and insurance funds. They could thus not be lent
out for the kind of speculative positions taken by London
market makers.
    But Hauck said the system in London could be criticised for
being too distant from those it should serve.

<BODY>World Bank President Barber Conable
called on Japan to boost investment in developing nations, for
its own sake as well as that of the world economy.
    "Japan has the means to make a major contribution to
development in the Third World," he told about 500 Japanese
businessmen and academics. "I would be pleased with additional
support."
    With 25 pct of the world's total banking assets, Japan
could do more to help assist indebted Third World countries
develop roads, bridges and other infrastructure, he said.
    Conable said additional commercial bank investment would
also be to Japan's advantage.
    It would profit from rechannelling its huge trade surplus
into Third World economies -- notably those in South America,
China and India -- that are likely to expand faster than those
in the developed world, he said.
    Japan is now the second largest shareholder in the Bank's
concessionary lending affiliate, the International Development
Association (IDA). It has also agreed recently to expand its
contribution to another affiliate, the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), Conable noted.
    Conable said the World Bank was expanding its structural
adjustment loans, designed to encourage developing countries to
open their economies more to free competition and trade.
    "Adjustment loans could rise to 30 pct (of total World Bank
loans) in the near future, though maybe not this year," Conable
told Reuters after his speech.
    Such loans currently account for slightly over 20 pct.

<BODY>Soviet officials said foreign
businessmen are expressing strong interest in establishing
joint enterprises in the Soviet Union and already 30
preliminary agreements had been signed with Western firms.
    But Western economic experts described foreign business
interest as cautious and noted that no final contracts had been
sealed to set up joint ventures on Soviet territory.
    Moscow last year invited companies in socialist, developing
and capitalist countries to start joint ventures as part of a
programme to open up the Soviet Union's foreign trade ties.
    At the same time, a number of Soviet ministries and
enterprises received the right to deal directly on world
markets. Previously the Ministry of Foreign Trade monopolised
all import and export business.
    Explaining the changes at a news conference today, Deputy
Prime Minister Vladimir Kamentsev said they had received a
mixed reaction in the foreign press but a warm response from
businessmen.
    Over 200 proposals for establishing joint ventures had been
received from foreign firms, 121 of which had been judged of
mutual interest, he said.
    Thirty protocols had been signed and 12 projects were
"practically implemented," including ventures with Finnish,
Japanese, West German and American firms, he added.
    But Western diplomats specialising in Soviet economic
affairs said the protocols were not legally binding and not a
single contract had been finalised.
    "The Soviet Union is selling the joint venture idea very
hard because it wants to obtain new technology cheaply, but I
would say business reaction in the West has been cool so far,"
commented one diplomat.
    Asked why this was so, he said the rules for running joint
ventures were still unclear and no Western firm wanted to be
the first to take a major financial risk.
    Kamentsev, flanked by Foreign Trade Minister Boris Aristov,
Foreign Trade Bank Chairman Yuri Ivanov and other officials,
repeated terms for the establishment of joint ventures,
including the ground-rule that the Soviet side must have a
stake of at least 51 pct in any enterprise.
    He said some businessmen had the mistaken impression that
foreign partners could only take profits from the products
which their enterprises exported.
    "I would like to stress that the foreign partner can take
profits from all the products which his venture produces
according to his share of the capital," Kamentsev said.
    He added that the Soviet Union was interested in "long-term
and stable contacts" with foreign firms and was offering a
number of tax breaks to companies which invested here.
    Speaking about the reform giving individual Soviet trading
organisations more autonomy, Kamentsev said 21 ministries and
75 enterprises now had the right to deal for themselves on
world markets.
    Organisations enjoying this right handled 25 pct of total
Soviet trade including 40 pct of trade in machines and tools,
he said.
    The Ministry of Foreign Trade continued to conduct business
for the remaining ministries and state enterprises and
supervised trade in essential products such as food.

    In a statement, the Finance Ministry said the process for

    Banking sources in London had been quoted earlier as saying
the British banks were balking at signing the package in an

"confirming said commitment."
    The ministry said the books on the package would be closed
by mid-April and the first 3.5 billion dlrs of the new money

<BODY>Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will
visit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S.
Anger over Japanese trade policies, but Western diplomats said
they believed his chances of success were slim.
    Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and
widespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will be
hard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S.
President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said.
    News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided
with news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surplus
last month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier.
    It also came one day after the Reagan Administration's
Economic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action
against Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint
trade agreement on computer microchips.
    Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one
designed to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in the
short-term, the other to redirect the country in the medium
term away from its over-dependence on exports for growth.
    But government officials said political infighting could
rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent
one from seeing the light of day.
    Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up
a package of short-term economic measures until after its
1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would
amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate.
    But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for
his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by
opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan.
    Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the
U.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his ruling
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its own
measures.
    He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis
of the government's plans, without losing face in parliament
over the budget, political analysts said.
    Officials working on the government's short-term economic
package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on
loans by government corporations, deregulation, measures to
pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in
the form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment.
    They said a record portion of state investment planned for
the entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first
half, probably over 80 pct.
    Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy
Reagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S.
Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade
deficit.
    To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is also
likely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-term
economic plans.
    A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan
governor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final
report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days
before Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington.
    Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to
Maekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and are
likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as
agricultural reform and land policy, officials said.
    While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed
as possible, they said the political realities might force them
to water down some of the committee's recommendations.
    A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy
might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes
massive restructuring, officials said. The subcommittee
projects that the current account surplus will fall to less
than two pct of Japan's total output, or gross national
product, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, which
measures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pct
of gnp.
    The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for
Japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual
appreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around
1993, from 150 now.

<BODY>Reports the Soviet Union has lately
extended its recent buying programme by taking five to eight
raws cargoes from the free market at around 30/40 points under
New York May futures highlight recent worldwide demand for
sugar for a variety of destinations, traders said.
    The Soviet buying follows recent whites buying by India,
Turkey and Libya, as well as possible raws offtake by China.
    Some 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes could have changed hands in
current activity, which is encouraging for a sugar trade which
previously saw little worthwhile end-buyer enquiry, they added.
    Dealers said a large proportion of the sales to the Soviet
Union in the past few days involved Japanese operators selling
Thai origin sugar.
    Prices for nearby shipment Thai sugars have tightened
considerably recently due to good Far Eastern demand, possibly
for sales to the Soviet Union or to pre-empt any large block
enquiries by China, they said.
    Thai prices for March/May 15 shipments have hardened to
around 13/14 points under May New York from larger discounts
previously, they added.

sugar in the near term, possibly towards an overall requirement

1.8 mln tonnes have already been taken up, they said.

tonnes of whites while India had further whites purchases of
two to three cargoes for Mar/Apr at near 227 dlrs a tonne cost
and freight and could be seeking more. Libya was also a buyer
this week, taking two cargoes of whites which, for an
undisclosed shipment period, were reported priced around
229/230 dlrs a tonne cost and freight, they added.
    Futures prices reacted upwards to the news of end-buyer
physicals offtake, although much of the enquiry emerged
recently when prices took an interim technical dip, traders
said.
    Pakistan is lined up shortly to buy 100,000 tonnes of
whites although traders said the tender, originally scheduled
for tomorrow, might not take place until a week later.
    Egypt will be seeking 20,000 tonnes of May arrival white
sugar next week, while Greece has called an internal EC tender
for 40,000 tonnes of whites to be held in early April, for
arrival in four equal parts in May, June, July and August.

<BODY>A scheme to distribute surplus food
free to the poor in the European Community (EC), which was due
to expire next Tuesday, will be partially extended for a
further month, an EC Commission spokesman said.
    He added the executive Commission has not yet decided
whether the scheme should become a permanent feature of the
EC's struggle to find a use for its massive stocks of farm
produce.
    Almost 60,000 tonnes of cereals, sugar, beef, butter and
other food have been authorised for distribution under an
operation sanctioned by EC farm ministers on January 20 in
which charities act as executive Commission agents.
    The original idea was to help the needy survive this year's
unusually cold European winter.
    The spokesman said the Commission was extending the scheme
fully in Greece, which has recently been hit by unseasonal
snowstorms, for the month of April.
    Other EC countries would be authorised to use stocks of
food for which they have already applied under the scheme up to
April 30. The spokesman said this would enable distribution of
flour, semolina, sugar and olive oil at a relatively high rate
next month.
    He said the Commission, which has powers to continue most
aspects of the scheme without consulting ministers further,
will be considering soon whether it should be made permanent.
    Cost, which has already reached around 65 mln European
currency units, would be a major consideration.
    End-January stocks included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter,
520,000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals.

<BODY>India is searching for non-communist
countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and
conserve foreign exchange.
    Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and
electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are
all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,
chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.
    Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in
1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading
Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).
    "The two state trading corporations are free to use their
buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian
exports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that
private firms are excluded from countertrading.
    One trade source said India has targetted countries that
depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign
imports.
    However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part
of India's total trading and are likely to account for less
than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade
during the nine months ended December, the sources said.
    Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65
billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,
against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.
    However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern
Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.
    Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of
agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude
oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,
against three billion in 1985/86.
    Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help
narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still
insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,
Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.
    The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96
billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion
in the current fiscal year.
    But the push to include non-communist countries in
countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow
growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,
shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.
    One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting
countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made
discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot
officially support bartering.
    The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore
exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.
    "MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that
preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind
for goods and services sold to India," a trade official said,
adding that the policy remains flexible.
    "We also take into account other factors such as prices at
which the goods and services are offered to India," the trade
official said.
    Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign
companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs
and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance
if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade
sources said.
    Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean
firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln
dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.

<BODY>The Swiss National Bank bought dollars
against yen today, a spokesman for the bank said.
    He declined to say how many dollars the bank bought or when
precisely it intervened.
    Swiss foreign exchange dealers described the National
Bank's purchases as modest, perhaps amounting to no more than
20 or 30 mln dlrs.
    The Bank of France, which was reported buying dollars
against the yen in Paris, had made inquiries with Swiss banks
as well, and the Bundesbank had also intervened. Bank of Japan
dollar purchases today were perhaps 1.2 to 1.5 billion dlrs.
    Dealers said this tended to confirm the market's impression
that major industrial countries had agreed at the Paris meeting
on an effective floor for the dollar of 148 yen, and the market
seemed ready to test it.
    Commercial clients were also selling dollars against the
yen as the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 drew
closer. Today's dealings in spot currencies are booked for
March 31.
    One dealer said he had the feeling Japanese companies had
been asked by the Bank of Japan not to sell dollars at this
point, but some, while sticking to the letter of that request,
were offering dollars forward today, rather than lose out if
the dollar fell further.
    The run on the dollar against the yen came in a market
thinned by the absence of many dealers for a Forex Club meeting
in Hamburg.
    Trading was, in fact, rather light against currencies other
than the yen, the dollar holding little changed through the
day.
    The market now expected the U.S. Federal Reserve to
intervene in support of the dollar. "But they will probably do
it only half-heartedly, so I don't think it will matter too
much on rates," one dealer said.

    For the 12 months ended in February, the CPI rose an

and declines in new car prices and finance charges were
responsible for the moderation.

6.6 pct in January, but were still 18 pct below levels of a

    Housing prices rose 0.4 pct in February after a 0.5 pct
January increase, largely due to a rise in fuel oil prices.
    Fuel oil prices were up 4.4 pct in February after

price levels of February 1986.
    Food prices rose 0.2 pct last month after a 0.5 pct January

as in January, but meat, poultry, fish and eggs cost less for a
third consecutive month, the department said.
    Medical care rose 0.3 pct in February to a level 7.1 pct
above one year ago, because of higher costs for prescription
and non-prescription drugs and medical supplies, the department
said.
    The index for apparel and upkeep rose 0.7 pct in February
after a 0.4 pct increase in January. The department said the
introduction of higher priced spring merchandise, particularly
men's clothing, was responsible for the advance.
    Prices for other goods and services rose 0.7 pct in
February following a 1.1 pct increase in January. Tobacco
prices, up 0.9 pct after a 2.0 pct January increase, accounted
for 30 pct of the index rise, the department said.

<BODY>Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou
said today that the Greek armed froces were ready to tackle any
aggressors following the sailing of a Turkish research vessel
and warships towards disputed waters in the Aegean Sea.
    Papandreou told an emergency cabinet meeting in Athens "the
military readiness of our country is able now to give a very
hard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out
military actions."
    He said the activities of the research vessel could be
aimed at partitioning the Aegean.
    "The air force, navy and army are in a state of alert,"
General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the Turkish General
Staff, told a news conference.
    He said the Turkish research ship Sismik 1, escorted by an
unspecified number of warships, would sail into disputed waters
in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning.
    Ergenc told Reuters later that all leave had been cancelled
for members of the armed forces in the Aegean coast area.
    The Turkish government said yesterday it had licensed the
state-owned Turkish Petroleum Corp to explore for oil in
international waters around three Greek islands off Turkey.
     Greece and Turkey have long-standing disputes over areas
of the Aegean and the presence of Turkish troops in Cyprus.
    The latest row erupted when the Greek government said last
month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium
which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos
and would drill in the same area after the takeover.
    Ergenc told the news conference the alert followed a
government decision that Turkey should protect its interests
"because of measures Greece has been taking in the Aegean in
violation of international agreements."
    Asked how Turkey would react if Greece attacked any of the
vessels, he said "If there is an attack, it is clear what has to
be done. An attack on a warship is a cause for war." But he
added "We are not in a state of war. The measures taken by the
military are directed towards protecting our rights."
    Greece said yesterday it would defend its national rights
in the Aegean and urged Turkey to accept reference of the
dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
    Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yalim Eralp told
reporters today this was unacceptable because of preconditions
Athens had attached.
    In Athens, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou said that if the
Turkish vessel Sismik 1 began research operations "we will
hinder it, of course not with words, as it cannot be stopped
with words."
    Greek newspapers said the armed forces were on alert and
navy ships had gone to the Aegean. But government spokesman
Yannis Roubatis did not confirm the move, saying only "The Greek
fleet is not at its naval base."
    Papandreou said that a map issued in Turkey showed 95 pct
of the areas proposed for research were on the Greek
continental shelf.
    Papandreou told the U.S. And NATO that if they had a part
in orchestrating the present crisis in order to force Greece to
negotiate with Turkey, the Greek government would not accept
it.
    Papandreou has maintained in the past that he will not
negotiate with Ankara until Turkey recognises Greek rights in
the Aegean and withdraws its troops from Cyprus.
    He said that in the case of war with Turkey it would not be
possible for Greece to discuss the future of American military
bases here. Asked by reporters if he would close the U.S. Bases
in Greece in the event of war, Papandreou replied "Obviously,
and perhaps even before the war."

<BODY>Sports carmaker Dr. Ing. H.C.F.
Porsche AG &lt;PSHG.F> said it expects to post a satisfactory
profit in 1986/87, with domestic volume sales seen lower but
U.S. Sales anticipated higher.
    Managing board chairman Peter Schutz said domestic sales
were expected to fall to 9,000 in the year ending July 31 from
11,340 in 1985/86. U.S. Sales should rise to more than 30,000
from 28,670 last year.
    Schutz made no specific profit or sales forecasts. Last
month the company said it expected net profit to fall below 70
mln marks this year from 75.3 mln marks in 1985/86.
    For sales, Porsche expects its overall world volume this
year to be above 50,000. Sales last year stood at 53,254,
Schutz said. His expectations of a satisfactory profit were
based on a combination of price rises and cost-cutting, he
added.
    The expected drop in West German sales this year would be
the result of the so-called "grey market" for Porsche cars, he
said. When the dollar was strong against the mark, many
Porsches had been bought locally in West Germany for illegal
export to the U.S.
    Porsche has previously said domestic sales in the 1986/87
first half fell to 3,267 from 5,387 in the same 1985/86 period.
    The fact that U.S. Sales will account for a larger
percentage of overall sales this year than before does not pose
problems for profit, the Porsche board said.
    In the last 12 months it has raised U.S. Prices by around
20 pct without suffering any decline in sales. At the same time
Porsche has hedged its dollar-denominated business for the
1986/87 business year, finance director Heinz Branitzki.
    Branitzki put Porsche's hedging costs in 1985/86 at 28 mln
marks.
    In a speech to the annual meeting, Schutz said third-party
orders placed with Porsche's engineering research centre in
Weissach were rising and should top 100 mln marks this year for
the first time.
    Porsche's net profit dropped sharply to 75.3 mln marks in
1985/86 from 120.4 mln marks in 1984/85.

<BODY>A final compromise proposal on cocoa
buffer stock rules presented by International Cocoa
Organization, ICCO, council chairman Denis Bra Kanon is swiftly
gaining acceptance by consumer and producer members, delegates
said.
    "We are close, nearer than ever to accepting it, but we
still have some work to do," producer spokesman Mama Mohammed of
Ghana told Reuters after a producers' meeting.
    European Community, EC, delegates said EC consumers
accepted the package in a morning meeting and predicted "no
problems" in getting full consumer acceptance.
    Delegates on both sides are keen to come to some agreement
today, the last day of the fortnight-long council meeting, they
said.
    The compromise requires that buffer stock purchases from
non-ICCO member countries cannot exceed 15 pct of total buffer
stock purchases, delegates said. The non-member cocoa issue has
been among the most contentious in the rules negotiations.
    The 15 pct figure, up five percentage points from earlier
proposals, represents a concession to consumers, delegates
said. They have demanded a larger allowance for non-member
cocoa in the buffer stock than producers have wanted.
    Another problem area, delegates said, was the question of
price differentials for different origins of cocoa bought into
the buffer stock, by which the buffer stock manager could
fairly compare relative prices of different cocoas offered to
him.
    The compromise narrowed the range of differentials between
the origins from what previous proposals had detailed -- a move
some delegates described as "just fiddling."
    But the adjustments may prove significant enough to appease
some countries that were not satisfied with the original
proposed differentials assigned to them, delegates said.
    The compromise also stated buffer stock purchases on any
day would be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate or
forward positions, delegates said.
    If the compromise is accepted by the council, most
consumers and producers want buffer stock rules to take effect
next week, or as soon as practically possible.
    The full council is scheduled to meet around 1500 GMT to
discuss the compromise, and could agree on it then if all
parties are satisfied, they said. Consumers are due to meet
before the council.

<BODY>India is searching for non-communist
countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and
conserve foreign exchange.
    Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and
electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are
all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,
chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.
    Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in
1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading
Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).
    "The two state trading corporations are free to use their
buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian
exports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that
private firms are excluded from countertrading.
    One trade source said India has targetted countries that
depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign
imports. But countertrade deals still make up only a small part
of India's total trading and are likely to account for less
than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade
during the nine months ended December, the sources said.
    Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65
billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,
against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.
    However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern
Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.
    Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of
agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude
oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87.

<BODY>Venezuela will shortly send creditor
banks a term sheet specifying the changes agreed last month in
the country's 20.3 billion dlr public sector debt rescheduling,
finance minister Manuel Azpurua said.
    Azpurua told reporters yesterday the document is in its
"final phase' of preparation, and will be soon be sent to banks
for approval.
    "We expect that once the term sheet is received and analysed
by the banks, it will be approved in a relatively short time,'
Azpurua said.
    Under the new rescheduling agreement reached February 27,
payments on Venezuela's public debt were extended from 12 to 14
years and the interest rate dropped from 1 and 1/8 to 7/8 of a
pct above LIBOR.
    In addition, payments for the 1987-1989 period were lowered
from 3.82 billion dlrs to 1.350 billion dlrs. Venezuelan
officials said this amounted to an effective grace period,
something the banks had refused to grant.
    The agreement replaced a February, 1986 rescheduling accord
which Venezuela asked banks to revise, citing a 40 pct drop in

<BODY>Commercial Union Assurance &lt;CUAC.L>, a
composite insurance company in the U.K., Said it is arranging a
financing facility totalling 750 mln European Currency Units
(ECUs) which will now include a medium term note program.
    Barry Cameron-Smail, Commercial Union's treasurer, said the
new financing will not increase its debt outstanding but rather
act as an umbrella for all its financing needs.
     Commercial Union has had a Euro-commercial paper program
since the autumn of 1985 and a guilder commercial paper program
since January 1986.
    Cameron-Smail said Commercial Union decided on having the
financing denominated in ECUs because it is more stable than
most major currencies, and because it would give greater
flexibility in its financings as it expands operations abroad.
    Although banks are anxious to develop a market for medium
term notes, only a few companies such as Electrolux AB and
Pepsico Inc have gone so far as to arrange one. Commercial
Union is the first U.K. Company to set up such a program.
    Cameron-Smail said the company seeks to help the
development of such a market as it would provide a new funding
base for its medium term assets.
     Cameron-Smail said that aside from traditional lines of
business, Commercial Union would like to move into other areas
where it may not be able to fund the assets itself. "This (the
medium term note program) will be the platform for developing
those assets," he said.
    He said Commercial Union will work closely with dealers for
the note program to find the right pricing level to satisfy
investor demands. The program will be investor driven, he
noted, adding that the company wants the notes placed with end
investors and not traded in the secondary market.
    Commercial Union will be able to issue medium term notes in
U.S. Dollars or sterling, with the dollar notes listed in
Luxembourg, while the sterling notes will be listed in London.
    Bankers expect that the maturities will be concentrated in
the one to five year area.
    The dealers for the program are Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd, Goldman Sachs International,
Swiss Bank Corporation International Ltd and S.G. Warburg and
Co Ltd.

<BODY>Westinghouse Electric Corp said
earnings per share growth will exceed sales growth and will be
in the double digit range through 1989.
    In 1986, the company earned 4.42 dlrs a share on revenues
of 10.7 billion dlrs.
    Speaking at a meeting for securities analysts, Douglas
Danforth, Westinghouse's chairman, said the company's sales
growth target is about 8.5 pct a year for 1988 and 1989, "given
an economic environment that remains on a moderate growth
course." He also said the company will make acquisitions, but
he did not specify particular targets.
    Paul E. Lego, senior executive vice president told the
analysts "our plans do not call for a multibillion dlr
acquisition, even though our balance sheet can handle one.
Despite this disclaimer, if we identify a major acquisition
that has significnt value-creating for Westinghouse...we will
consider it." He said the company would consider an acquisition
candidate that is in an area compatable with Westinghouse's
primiary businesses.
    Danforth said the corportation was focused in several key
areas including defense electronics, financial services,
broadcasting, electrical products and services for construction
and industrial and utility markets.
    Danforth added that he expects Westinghouse's sales to grow
faster than the markets the corportation serves and "surely
faster than GNP."
    He said earnings per share growth is expected to
consistently exceed the Standard and Poor's 500 index and
return on equity will remain in the 18 to 21 pct range.
    Leo W. Yochum, senior executive vice president for finance,
told the analysts "we will consider buying back stock" but
there are no current plans for such a buyback.
    Yochum said that at the company's current level of earnings
it could comfortably maintain higher debt levels and that
Westinghouse will use its debt capacity to improve shareholder
value.
    Last year, Westinghouse established a 790 mln dlrs
restructuring reserve to be used for plant consolodation,
assett writedowns and other items. Yochum said, the company
spent 306 mln dlrs of that reserve in 1986 and will spend 344
mln dlrs of the reserves in 1987. The balance will be used in
1988. He also said, capital expenditures should be about 400
mln dlrs in 1987.

<BODY>A new Rabobank mortgage bond, whose
terms dealers considered extremely generous, was in heavy
demand on the Amsterdam bourse today, bond dealers said.
    Rabobank, not anticipating a strong two-day rally in Dutch
bonds, on Wednesday set an issue price of 99.50 pct for a 6.25
pct eight-year open mortgage bond, giving it a yield about 1/4
pct higher than the market average.
    Rabobank stopped trading in the bond five minutes after the
bourse opened, but already between 200 and 300 mln guilders
worth had been sold, a Rabobank spokesman said. One Japanese
investor took 50 mln guilders alone, a dealer said.
    Later, the bank proposed to allot only 30 pct of
subscriptions, causing a general outcry among traders. Rabobank
finally gave in to bourse demands to honour all subscriptions.
    "We simply did not expect prices to rise so much," a Rabobank
spokesman said." Since the pricing, the bond price index has
risen 0.9 to 117.3, and the average state loan yield has fallen
accordingly to 6.04 pct.
    Two weeks ago, Rabobank issued a 250 mln guilder 6.75 pct
bond at par, giving it a yield 0.40 above the average bank loan
yields that day of 6.35 pct. The issue was heavily

<BODY>The British government may revoke the
licences of selected Japanese banks and securities companies
operating in London's financial City when they come up for
renewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening up
Japan's markets to foreign competition, government sources
said.
    "We can't say "yes, we are going to do it (revoke licences)"
but this is definitely being considered," an official said.
    His comments came after the government was formally urged
today by a cross-section of influential MPs to take joint
retaliatory action with the United States against Japan.
    Britain has grown increasingly impatient with Japanese
trade practices. "There's a sense of urgency here now, but the
emphasis is on securing - not undermining - our interests in
Japan," another government official told Reuters.
    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday that
Britain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in the
Financial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Bill to retaliate
against countries that do not offer reciprocal market access.
    She clearly had Japan in mind, government sources said.
    The U.K. Last year showed a trade defict with Japan of 3.7
billion stg, official figures show.
    A parliamentary motion, signed by 98 MPs, today urged the
U.K. Government to "coordinate action with the President of the
United States, and through the Department of Trade and
Industry, to suspend all further applications from Japanese
communications companies for equipment approval by the British
Approvals Board for Telecommunications, and all further
applications from Japanese financial institutions for licences"
until authorities in Japan stopped imposing what the MPs called
"restrictive conditions" on the bid by (Cable and Wireless PLC)
(cawl.L) and its U.S. And Japanese partners for a stake in
Japan's international telecommunications market.
    The motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross-section
of MPs, reflecting the strength of feeling inside Parliament.
Parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure on
the Conservative government to take firm action.
    Officials said another option now being considered by the
U.K. Is to refuse issuing new banking licences to Japanese
institutions. That could be done under the government's
proposed Banking Bill now moving through parliament.
    58 Japanese financial institutions are authorised to deal
in London, of which 29 are banks. In Tokyo, 14 London-based
firms are authorised to do financial business, officials said.
    The new financial services and banking acts offer Britain
an alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise denied
under legally-binding international trade agreements.
    "The Financial Services Act gives (Trade and Industry
Secretary Paul) Channon power to stop firms from engaging in
investment, banking and insurance," one official said.
    "This point has been made to the Japanese at official level
a number times," the official added.
    Britain and France are now working together to urge that
the European Community take collective action against Japan,
but by working within EC treaties, another official said.
    British Trade Minister Alan Clark said this week in a radio
interview that the European Community should build barriers
against Japanese imports through certification procedures
similar to those facing European exporters in Japan.
    "There comes a point where you cannot resist any longer," he
said, adding "(such barriers) can't be put in place overnight."
Clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade
"strikes at the basis of whether British industry is to have a
fair access to an extremely large market (Japan) which is
itself in a very dominant position (in) certain aspects of our
own domestic market ... It is really a question of fairness."
    The situation is only likely to worsen following news that
Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by more
than 70 pct in February, year-on-year, to 8.14 billion dlrs
from 5.7 billion in January, political sources said.
    But Clark said in his interview that the issues of visible
trade and access to financial markets should be kept separate.
    Should Britain decide to act against Japanese financial
institutions, it would most likely focus on the smaller, rather
than larger ones, to minimise any risks to its role as a global
business centre, government sources said. Japan's four largest
securities houses are members of the London Stock Exchange.
    In Washington, White House officials said President Reagan
was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for
breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States.
    There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on
the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb
Japanese exports to the United States but officials said the
move could come today or early next week.
    Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan
included tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which
use semiconductors.

<BODY>The U.K. Treasury issued to the Bank of
England 250 mln stg in two tranches of existing index-linked
stocks, for first dealings on Monday, the Bank said.
    The issues are 150 mln stg of 2-1/2 pct index-linked
Treasury stock due 2011 and 100 mln of 2-1/2 pct index-linked
Treasury due 2024. The latter stock is free of tax to residents
abroad (FOTRA).
    The bonds will be available to the U.K. Government bond
market from Monday at certified prices of 113.00 stg pct for
the 2-1/2s of 2011 and 85-24/32 stg pct for the 2-1/2s of 2024.
    Several dealers had expected the Bank of England to
announce further issues of index-linked bonds today in the
light of strength seen in this sector of the market over the
past few days. Some prices advanced by as much as 1-1/2 points
yesterday as the rest of the market eased back further.
    However, one or two traders expressed surprise that the
authorities had issued further bonds of any kind in the light
of the nervous conditions prevailing in the market.
    In such relatively small amounts, the new issues were
unlikely to have a significantly harmful effect on Government
bond prices in general, dealers said.
    Prices of index-linked bonds fell back slightly after the
stock tranches were announced, with the 2-1/2 pct index-linked
stock due 2016 quoted at 102-25/32 stg pct after 102-29/32
shortly before the announcement.

<BODY>Galactic Resources
Ltd, earlier reporting a 1986 loss of 25.6 mln U.S. dlrs, said
it adopted a more conservative accounting policy, similar to
other gold producers' accounting for exploration costs.
    As a result, the company retroactively charged all past
exploration and related administration costs incurred on its
properties against expenses in 1986, 1985 and 1984.
    Under the new policy, all future exploration and related
administration costs will be written off to expenses rather
than capitalized as an intangible asset, it said.
    Galactic said the accounting change resulted in a 22.8 mln
U.S. dlr charge against 1986 earnings. It did not immediately
disclose the affect of the change on prior years' results.
    The new accounting policy is not expected to adversely
affect working capital position, future cash flows or the
company's ability to conduct ongoing business operations, it
said.
    Galactic said the charge includes 9.9 mln U.S. dlrs of
costs concerning its Summitville Mine leach pad and 8.9 mln
U.S. dlrs in waste removal costs, dyke construction and other
mine developments.
    Galactic said under the prior accounting policy, the
Summitville mine expenses would have been amortized over the
life of the mine and charged against future earnings.
    The change will also result in lower depreciation and
amortization charges against income of about 52 U.S. dlrs an
ounce of gold produced in future periods, based on total
estimated reserves of 617,000 ounces.
    Galactic said March leaching production at Summitville is
expected to exceed 2,500 ounces, raising gold equivalent
production since the June 5, 1986 start of leaching to 65,000
ounces.

<BODY>Honeywell Inc said it has
completed the sale of 57.5 pct of its Honeywell Information
Systems &lt;HIS> computer business to &lt;Compagnie des Machines
Bull> of France and &lt;NEC Corp> of Japan for 527 mln dlrs in
cash.
    Honeywell said it will use much of the money to reduce
short-term debt incurred last December when the company
purchased the Sperry Aerospace Group.
    Honeywell said the sale of HIS has created a new dedicated
computer company jointly owned by Bull, NEC and Honeywell.
    The new privately held company, named Honeywell Bull, is
42.5 pct owned by Honeywell Inc, 42.5 pct by Bull and 15 pct by
NEC, the new company said.
    Honeywell added that terms of the agreement with NEC and
Bull allow it to reduce its current 42.5 pct stake in the new
company to 19.9 pct at the end of 1988 by selling just over
half its shares to Bull. Book value at the time will determine
the move's pricing, Honeywell said.
    Honeywell chairman and chief executive officer, Edson
Spencer, said the move is the last major step in Honeywell's
restructuring.
    "As the leading worldwide supplier of of automation and
controls for buildings, industry, aerospace and defense,
Honeywell is now focusing its management, technical and
financial resources on high market share business," Spencer
said.
    Honeywell said it expects to be Honeywell Bull's largest
customer, purchasing computers for its own internal data
processing, for integration into Honeywell buidling and
industrial automation systems and for resale to the U.S.
governement.
    Honeywell said HIS's Federal Systems Division is now a
wholly owned unit of Honeywell Inc, and has been named
Honeywell Federal Systems Inc.
    Honeywell said it accounted for HIS as a discontinued
operation in 1986, and will account for its future interest on
a cost basis, recording any dividends as received.
    Honeywell Bull said it will continue to develop its product
line and build its business in integrated systems for
networking, database management and transaction processing.
    The new company said its board will have nine members,
including the chairman and chief executive officer.
    Bull will have four members, Honeywell two and NEC one, the
new company, which began worldwide operations today, said.
    It added that Jacques Stern, Bull's chairman and chief
executive officer, will serve as Honeywell Bull's chairman of
the board, while Jerome Meyer, formerly executive vice
president of Honeywell Information Systems, was named president
and chief executive officer.

<BODY>New Irish Prime Minister Charles
Haughey, faced with a debt-ridden economy, will have to produce
a harsh budget next week to impress financial markets, appease
political opponents and maintain his tenuous hold on power,
analysts said.
    For Haughey, who failed to win an overall majority in last
month's election, only scraped back into power when the speaker
in parliament stepped in with his casting vote to decide a tied
vote on who would be the next Prime Minister.
    Heading a minority government and faced with a stagnant
economy weighed down by debt, he has little room for manoeuvre.
    The national debt has now reached 24.3 billion punts --
10,000 dlrs for every man, woman and child on the island and
per capita three times the size of Mexico's.
    Its 19 pct unemployment rate is one of the highest in the
European Community and 30,000 youngsters emigrate every year.
The 58 pct income tax level could hardly be raised again.
    Haughey, declining to be tied down on specifics, promised
on the election trail to get Ireland out of the debt trap with
an annual growth rate of 2.5 pct, compared to central bank
predictions of 1.5 pct. Jobs were his top priority, he said.
    For his crucial first budget, Haughey has ruled out any
increase in the level of government borrowing and forecast
"widespread cutbacks with severe restrictions right across the
board."
    Finance Minister Ray MacSharry also stressed that some of
the 187,000 civil service jobs must go to trim Ireland's annual
public wages bill of 2.84 billion punts.
    "The big question now is to what extent he will grasp the
nettle and cut in next Tuesday's budget," said Kevin Barry,
economist with National and City Brokers.
    "You have to cut the Exchequer Borrowing Recquirement (EBR)
substantially and swiftly. He has to do it now," Barry said.
    Noting that last year's EBR was 2.145 billion punts, he
said "Two billion would be good news. The markets are already
taking the view it is going to be tough."
    "He has absolutely no room to maneouvre. He cannot spend to
stimulate the economy. I don't see any good news in the
short-term."
    But he, like other analysts, rules out a debt-servicing
crisis that would mean calling in the International Monetary
Fund (IMF). "It's too easy to borrow aboard," he added.
    The steady rise of sterling, the currency of one of
Ireland's main trading partners, has been a boost to Irish
exporters with the country recording a 31 mln punt trade
surplus in February, the 10th surplus in a row.
    Political uncertainty is not a major factor for the punt
because the main political parties are all essentially
conservative with no major economic policy switches expected.
    New Fine Gael leader Alan Dukes, who replaced ousted Prime
Minister Garret Fitzgerald at the head of the main opposition
party, has pledged to back Haughey's budget if, as expected, he
gets tough.
    Haughey is four short of an overall majority and would have
to rely on the support of independent deputies if all four
opposition parties united to vote against him.
    But in today's climate of economic austerity, few
politicians would risk returning to the polls so soon and
Haughey could cling to power for at least another two years if
he brings in a belt-tightening budget next week, political
commentators say.
    The debt-laden economy is the great national preoccupation,
pushing firmly into the background for now Haughey's ultimate
dream of a united Ireland with the British out of the north.
    H.J. Heinz chairman Tony O'Reilly, one of the most
successful Irishmen in international business, stressed the
need for a frontal attack on the national debt, arguing "many of
our children have lost faith in the future."
    "Were there to be an uptick in world interest rates or a
precipitous decline in our parities, the effect on our economy
and on the provision of services by our government would be
catastrophic," he said.
    This island of 3.5 mln people has been living beyond its
means with a state spending spree on welfare benefits that
could not be financed by economic growth.

<BODY>The Agriculture Department's
widening of Louisiana gulf differentials will affect county
posted prices for number two yellow corn in ten states, a USDA
official said.
    All counties in Iowa will be affected, as will counties
which use the gulf to price corn in Illinois, Indiana,
Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama
and Louisiana, said Ron Burgess, Deputy Director of Commodity
Operations Division for the USDA.
    USDA last night notified the grain industry that effective
immediately, all gulf differentials used to price interior corn
would be widened on a sliding scale basis of four to eight cts,
depending on what the differential is.
    USDA's action was taken to lower excessively high posted
county prices for corn caused by high gulf prices.
    "We've been following this Louisiana gulf situation for a
month, and we don't think it's going to get back in line in any
nearby time," Burgess said.
    Burgess said USDA will probably narrow back the gulf
differentials when and if Gulf prices recede. "If we're off the
mark now because we're too high, wouldn't we be as much off the
mark if we're too low?" he said.
    While forecasting more adjustments if Gulf prices fall,
Burgess said no other changes in USDA's price system are being
planned right now.
    "We don't tinker. We don't make changes lightly, and we
don't make changes often," he said.

<BODY>Drought has resulted in a reduction
in China's estimated wheat crop this year to 87.0 mln tonnes,
2.0 mln below last year's harvest, the U.S. Agriculture
Department's officer in Peking said in a field report.
    The report, dated March 25, said imports in the 1987/88
season are projected at 8.0 mln tonnes, 1.0 mln tonnes above
the the current season's estimate.
    Imports from the United States are estimated at 1.5 mln
tonnes compared to only 150,000 tonnes estimated for the
1986/87 year, it said.
    After travelling to major wheat producing areas and
obtaining more information on the planted area, the total
planted area was estimated down 290,000 hectares due to the dry
fall, it said.
    The report said to compensate for the below normal
precipitation irrigation has increased as has the use of
fertilizer.
    While there are pockets where irrigation is not possible,
most of the wheat crop has access to some water and therefore
has emerged from dormancy and is doing well, the report said.
    It said scattered rain in many parts of China in the past
10 days has improved the situation but information on hail
damage in Anhui is incomplete.

<BODY>The United States told India it
could purchase a supercomputer because U.S. concerns over a
possible security breach had been removed.
    U.S. officials said the United States did not specify which
supercomputer it was willing to sell but had offered India a
choice.
    They declined to comment on a newspaper report that the
United States wanted to sell India a computer less powerful
than the Indians had sought.
    They said the United States was awaiting a response from
New Delhi.
    The New York Times, quoting unnamed government and industry
officials, said the United States wanted to sell a weaker-model
supercomputer to India.
    U.S. and Indian negotiatiors reached a tentative agreement
in December on security precautions for the sale of the
computer, which has a wide variety of military applications.
    "We have told the Indians that we ratify the tentative
agreement reached in December," a U.S. official said.
    India proposed to use the supercomputer to analyze weather
patterns to forecast monsoons.
    The sale of a U.S. supercomputer to a non-Western nation is
rare. This transaction was seen as a test of a
technology-sharing agreement signed by Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi and President Reagan in 1985.
    The American concern was that the advanced technology might
fall into the hands of the Soviet Union, which is India's main
weapons supplier.
    One condition calls for U.S. personnel to service the
computer in India for three years, a Pentagon spokesman said.
    The spokesman predicted the negotiations, which also
involved the State Department, could be quickly resolved.
    The only countries which make the supercomputer are the
United States and Japan.
    In New Delhi, Indian officials told Reuters that a U.S.
offer had been made.
    "An announcement will be made in 10 days to two weeks time,"
an official said.

<BODY>The International Cocoa Organization
(ICCO) Council reached agreement on rules to govern its buffer
stock, the device it uses to keep cocoa off the market to
stabilise prices, ICCO delegates said.
    The date on which the new rules will take effect has not
been decided but delegates said they expected them to come into
force early next week, after which the buffer stock manager can
begin buying or selling cocoa.
    Since prices are below the "may-buy" level of 1,655 Special
Drawing Rights a tonne set in the cocoa pact, the manager is
likely to buy cocoa sooon to support the market, they said.
    Delegates and traders said they expected the manager,
Juergen Plambeck, to intervene in the market within three weeks
of the pact coming into force.
    The rules permit him to buy and sell cocoa from origins or
the second hand market on an offer system, not by means of a
posted price as in the previous cocoa accord.
    The cocoa will be priced according to a fixed set of
differentials, ranging from 137 stg for most expensive Ghana
cocoa to zero for Malaysian cocoa.
    Purchases from non-members, such as Malaysia, will be
limited to 15 pct of the total stock and those on any one day
should be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate and
forward positions.
    The council meeting, which is expected to conclude two
weeks of sessions involving various working groups and the
council itself, was continuing, the delegates said.
    The current cocoa agreement came into force on January 20
during a previous meeting of the council which was unable to
agree on the rules to implement buffer stock operations.

<BODY>Marine Midland Banks Inc said in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it may
reclassify as "nonperforming" 359 mln dlrs of medium- and
long-term loans to Brazil.
    The company added that it expects first quarter 1987
earnings to be "down moderately" from year-earlier levels.
    "Continued suspension of interest payments on the medium-
and long-term debt could result in such loans being classified
as nonperforming and placed on nonaccrual," it said.
    However, it added its belief that it was "premature to
decide at this time" whether to reclassify the loans.
    Brazil announced Feb. 20 that it was temporarily suspending
interest payments on all its medium- and long-term foreign bank
debt.
    Marine Midland said its total Brazil outstandings as of the
end of 1986 were 653 mln dlrs, including 359 mln dlrs of
medium- and long-term loans and 294 mln dlrs of short-term
outstandings.
    As of Dec. 31, it had interest receivable of about five mln
dlrs on its medium- and long-term Brazil outstandings.
    If debt restructuring talks between Brazil and its creditor
banks are not completed by the end of the third quarter, the
company estimated Brazil's action would reduce its net income
for the year by about 22 mln dlrs.
    In the first quarter of 1986, Marine Midland reported 
record earnings of 38.2 mln dlrs, bolstered by certain
non-recurring securities gains.
    It said it expected lower first quarter 1987 earnings
because the money market cost of funds had increased, "narrowing
net interest spreads somewhat." It said the earnings projection
was based on "preliminary" 1987 data.

interest rates and other details have to be negotiated on a
bilateral basis with the creditor countries involved. No
details of the discussions here were immediately available.
    The agreement signed on Tuesday with Britain's Export
Credits Guarantee Department was the first in Nigeria's tour of
creditor nations. Okongwu left Paris today for London and is
due back in Nigeria on Monday, diplomatic sources said.
    Nigeria is hoping that further bilateral accords can be
concluded soon as this could encourage official export credit
agencies to renew insurance cover for exports to Nigeria.
    CoFACE suspended its cover for medium and long-term export
contracts with Nigeria in 1983, but maintained its cover for
current trade deals involving consumer goods with six-month
credit periods, CoFACE sources said.
    "We have an open position regarding Nigeria," the sources
said, adding that it was for French Finance Minister Edouard
Balladur to decide whether to renew full insurance cover.
    Nigeria is due to receive 900 mln dlrs in fresh export
credits this year from official agencies under a structural
adjustment program drawn up by Nigeria and the World Bank to
reschedule part of the country's 19 billion dlr foreign debt.
    But these credits cannot be approved until the export
credit agencies agree to resume insuring the credits.
    French exports to Nigeria were 3.42 billion francs in 1986,
down from 4.94 billion in 1985, while Nigeria's exports to
France were 5.63 billion francs in 1986, down from 15.33
billion in 1985. Details of Nigeria's official debts to France
were not immediately available.

    There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on

    Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan
include tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which use
semiconductors.
    The sources said the tariffs could be slapped on personal

aim of penalizing Japan's major electronic firms, including NEC

<BODY>The South African Reserve Bank,
confirming previous estimates, said real gross domestic product
in the 1986 fourth quarter grew at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 4.7 pct versus 4.6 pct in the third quarter and 1.3 pct
in the 1985 final quarter.
    The bank, in its latest quarterly review, said the nominal
growth rate for the year did not quite reach one pct after a
1.5 pct contraction in 1985.
    But it said when the strengthening of the terms of trade is
taken into account, the real GNP in 1986 advanced by 1.5 pct
compared with a decrease of 0.5 pct in 1985.
    GDP is the total value of goods and services produced by an
economy but omits income from abroad.  GNP includes such
payments or outflows.
    The bank also said there were indications the country's
economic recovery was becoming more broadly based.
    With the exception of commerce all major sectors of the
economy contributed to the fourth quarter rise in domestic
production.
    The bank said major increases in foreign reserves were
recorded in January, February and the first half of March 1987.
Reserves rose by 1.70 billion rand during January and February.
    Total reserves in 1986 declined by 189 mln rand to 5.70
billion rand and were equivalent to about 14.5 pct of the total
annual value of import payments.
    The current account surplus amounted to 7.20 billion rand
in 1986 versus 5.90 mln the previous year.
    The bank said continuing strength of the current account
has allowed foreign reserves to be "rebuilt to more comfortable
levels."
    "This has strengthened the authorities' hands in lending
support to the exchange rate of the rand if such action were to
be called for," the bank said.

<BODY>U.S. cotton farmers are likely to
plant about 10.6 mln acres in the coming season, based on an
average of estimates offered by cotton market analysts gearing
up for the U.S. Agriculture Department's 1987 planting
intentions report next Tuesday.
    The annual report gives cotton traders their first glimpse
of what U.S. production might be in the 1987/88 season, which
begins August 1.
    Trade and commission house forecasts ranged from 10.2 to
10.9 mln acres.
    On March 18 of last year, the USDA reported that cotton
farmers in 1986 intended to plant 9.71 mln acres.
    Four months later, the USDA estimated that 9.67 mln acres
had been planted as of June 1. By January, its estimate of 1986
planted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln.
    Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in
1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year's good
demand and firm prices will be repeated next year. Analysts
said those factors make cotton a profitable crop.
    "With cotton more attractive price-wise, I think there is
going to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton.
Soybeans are dirt cheap," said Lisbeth Keefe of Cargill
Investor Services, whose comments were echoed by other cotton
market specialists.
    Changes in the U.S. cotton program also could lead to
increased acreage, analysts said.
    They recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmers
who used part of their crop as collateral for government loans
were not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton in
government warehouses. But under the 1987 plan, the government
will not pick up the tab for storage.
    Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers from
participating in the program, which could result in more
cotton. "The cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of
25 pct of a farmer's base acreage," noted Judy Weissman of
Shearson Lehman Brothers. But farmers who elect not to
participate in the program are free to plant all the acreage 
they have.
    Some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yielding
Western states would be most likely to steer clear of the
program. "Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct," said
one commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in part
on forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during its
annual meeting in late January.
    But others disagreed. "I think some Western growers have
decided they should be in the program for security reasons.
There's a lot of comfort in knowing you'll be guaranteed the
government's loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. Anyone outside the
program is subject to the wiles of the market," said Walter
Brown, market analyst for a major California cotton producer.
    Some cotton specialists said their expectations for
increased acreage might not be verified in Tuesday's planting
intentions report. "Anything the USDA is announcing now is
based on information they gathered before their cotton program
was announced (on March 20)," one analyst cautioned. She said
traders will get a better idea of next year's cotton output
when the USDA's planted acreage report is released on July 9.
    Brown took that opinion a step further. "I don't think
planted acreage is important. What counts is the abandonment
rate," the difference between acreage planted and acreage
harvested.
    Brown said the abandonment rate this year was "pretty high"
at 15.5 pct because of weather problems in key producing
states. "More normal would be about six pct," he said.

    The meeting was called after reports that warships of both
countries were sailing towards a disputed oil exploration zone
of the Aegean.
    The statement said the tensions in the area had reached a
serious level and called on both countries to begin immediate
discussions. "Any intensification would make things worse," it
added.
    No attempt was made at the meeting to resolve the complex
dispute which was aimed at damage-limitation. Carrington said,
"I am of course anxious to help in any way I can, provided that
both Greece and Turkey, and the other allies, wish me to do so."

<BODY>The price of gold bullion and share
prices of North American gold stocks are benefiting from
continued weakness in the U.S. dollar, analysts said.
    "There's been a tug of war between the (currency)
speculators and the central banks over the U.S. dollar and it
looks like the game has gone to the speculators," said John Ing
at Maison Placements Canada Inc.
    The dollar remained close to post-World War II lows today
against the Japanese yen despite buying by several central
banks, including the Federal Reserve, dealers said.
    A drop in the dollar means uncertainty and gold is the
traditional hedge against uncertainty, Ing noted.
    Another analyst, Richard Cohen at Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd,
noted that "a lot of foreign investors are holding U.S. dollars.
If they see they are losing money, they move back into gold."
    A dollar decline also has inflationary implications, Ing
said, adding that Maison Placements sees inflation rising to a
four pct annual rate from the current level of about three pct.
    Ing predicts gold will peak at 510 dlrs this year from its
current level of about 416 dlrs per ounce. Cohen sees an
average price of 425 dlrs, and another analyst, Michael
Pickens, at Yorkton Securities, puts the average at 450 dlrs,
with a possible spike above 500 dlrs.
    However, gold stocks in the U.S. and Canada have risen far
faster in recent months than the price of the metal itself,
causing concern among analysts that a correction lies somewhere
in the future. But for now, all analysts say there is no sign
the buying pressure is slowing down. "The stocks have run an
incredible way," Cohen said.
    On U.S. markets today, ASA Ltd &lt;ASA> rose 4-1/8 to 61-1/2,
Campbell Red Lake Mines &lt;CRK> was up 1-3/8 and Newmont Gold
    The Toronto Stock Exchange gold index today was up 268
points at 8067.90. Hemlo Gold gained 1-1/4 at 26-3/4, LAC
Minerals was up 1-5/8 at 41, Placer Development rose 1-1/4 at
43-3/8 and Lacana Mining gained 1 at 18.
    Ing pointed out that the TSE gold index has gained 51 pct
since December 31, 1986, while the price of bullion has
increased six pct. "Canadian golds have been the top performing
index this year," he noted.
    In the U.S., there is "too much money chasing too few
stocks," Pickens said. And many investing institutions such as
pension funds and insurance companies still have excess cash,
he added.
    Cohen also noted that today's silver price break through
six dlrs an ounce indicates small investors are entering the
precious metals market and he expects the ratio between gold
and silver prices to narrow.

computers to multi-national companies.
    "We haven't been growing as fast as we'd like, but we are

customers want. "I don't believe in the slump of the market,"

    This operation will reinforce Bull's capital and reduce the
state's stake, prior to privatisation, the Ministry said in a
press release.
    The three "A" warrants will give the right to subscribe to
five Bull shares at a price of 46 francs until November 30,
1988 and the three "B" warrants the right to subscribe to five
shares at a price of 52 francs until November 30, 1989.
    The eight-year bond, which will be issued at par, will have
a payment date of April 28 and will increase Bull's capital by
1.2 billion francs in 1989.
    Bull shares were quoted at a close of 55.45 francs on the
Paris stock exchange today.
    The privatisation commission values Bull at a minimum of
six billion francs, the press release said.

<BODY>Latest consumer price data indicate
U.S. inflation will be moderate in 1987 even though it will be
above last year's pace, economists said.
    "Inflation is not such a constructive factor as this time
last year, but it's not building up a large head of steam,"
said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.
    U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the consumer price
index for all urban consumers, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4
pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain. Energy prices,
which fired January's data with a three pct rise, advanced a
more moderate 1.9 pct last month.
    The CPI came within the range of economists' expectations
and had little direct impact on U.S. financial markets.
    Among the key components of the report, transportation
prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct January gain
reflecting smaller price appreciation for motor fuels and
declines in new car prices and finance charges.
    "There are no pronounced pressures at the retail level,"
said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
    Economists said the latest CPI supports existing
expectations for an inflation rate of 3.5 to four pct in 1987.
    The CPI rose 1.1 pct from December 1985 to December 1986.
Without last year's energy price drop, it rose 3.8 pct.
    Economists said that upward pressure on import prices as a
result of the dollar's drop as well as the volatile energy
component warrant attention in case gains in these areas become
factored into the wider economic picture.
    "As long as those price rises do not become entrenched in
cost of living adjustments contained in labor contracts, thus
reducing international competitiveness, then the Federal
Reserve would probably be willing to tolerate four pct
inflation," said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.

<BODY>The federal Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) is expected to announce soon that it will
require an additional review of Genentech Inc's TPA heart drug,
a move that likely will delay the company's plans to
market the drug this spring, government and Wall Street sources
said.
    TPA, a bio-engineered blood-clot dissolving drug which
Genentech hopes to market under the name Activase, will be
reviewed by the FDA's cardiorenal advisory committee during the
panel's May 28-29 meeting, the sources said.
    Neither Genentech nor the FDA would confirm that a second
review of the drug had been set.
    "It's under consideration for the May 28-29 meeting," an FDA
official said. "It's on a draft agenda."
    Similarly, a Genentech spokeswoman said the FDA had not yet
notified it of the second advisory committee review.
    "We know it's a possibility, but as of this minute, we can't
confirm that we are on the agenda," she said.
    The spokeswoman said a second review had "always been a
possibility." But she declined to say how the review would
affect marketing plans before receiving official FDA word.
    The spokeswoman acknowledged that rumors of a second FDA
committee review had buffeted Genentech's stock yesterday on
Wall Street. The stock fell 2.75 dlrs a share to clsoe at 61.75
dlrs.
    TPA stands for tissue plasminogen activator, and would be
used on heart attack victims to clear blockage in a vein or
artery. Though other blood clot dissolvers are on the market,
TPA is said to be more effective and with fewer side effects.
    Analysts have projected the worldwide market for the drug
at as high as 1.5 billion dlrs a year.
    Stuart Weisbrod, a biotechnology analyst with Prudential
Bache Securities Inc., told Reuters the additional FDA review
likely would keep TPA off the market until at least November.
    Approval had been expected this spring.
    He said the FDA action prompted him to cut his estimate of
Genentech's 1987 earnings to about 40 cents a share from his
earlier projection of 67 cents a share.
    He said the delay would lower Genentech's 1987 revenues
from TPA to about five to six mln dlrs compared to an earlier
projection of 50 to 60 mln dlrs of 1987 revenues.

<BODY>Westinghouse Electric Corp &lt;WX> said
it is still open to a merger of its radio operations with
General Electrics Co's &lt;GE> NBC radio operations.
    "We have left the door open and GE is reassessing the
merger and so are we," Westinghouse chairman Douglas Danforth
told Reuters at the conclusion of a meeting before analysts.
    Danforth said he continues to see value in a merger between
Westinghouse's radio operation and those of NBC. 
    Discussions with NBC on the merger of the two companies'
radio units were suspended in December.
    Danforth reaffirmed that Westinghouse is interested in
acquisitions, saying the company is leaning toward acquisitions
in the 300 mln to 500 mln dlr range. He said, however, that
larger acquisitions are possible if they are the right fit.
    Danforth, who earlier today said he expects earnings growth
in the double-digit range through 1989, said he is comfortable
with analysts' predictions of 4.80 dlrs to 5.30 dlrs a share
this year. In 1986 the company earned 4.42 dlrs a share.
    He said the company has targeted waste energy systems and
hazardous waste removal, as some of the emerging growth areas
for the company.

that falls due between 1987 and 1992 and to obtain easier terms
on 5.8 billion dlrs of previously restructured debt.
    The talks have dragged on because of the banks' reluctance

Eurocurrency rates that it initially demanded.

<BODY>A cold air mass working its way
south from Canada may pose a threat to developing hard red
winter wheat in Oklahoma, according to Eugene Krenzler, wheat
specialist for the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension.
    "There is some threat. Some of the crop is far enough along
so that it's probably vulnerable," Krenzler said.
    Accu Weather meteorologist Dale Mohler said cold air moving
from the north could put temperatures in the middle 20's
fahrenheit as early as tonight, depending on development of a
low pressure area over southeast Colorado which could stall the
system.
    If impeded by the low-pressure area, the cold air could hit
Oklahoma and Texas as late as Monday morning. Temperatures
could stay in the mid-20's for up to eight hours, Mohler said.
    Krenzler said less than 10 pct of the Oklahoma wheat crop
has advanced to boot stage. The closer to that stage the more
vulnerable the head of the wheat is to cold weather, he said.
    "We can handle probably an hour or so down to 25 or 26
degrees (fahrenheit)," Krenzler said, "as long as we don't have
a lot of wind."
    "If we do get six hours down below 25 degrees I'd say we
have a good chance of significant damage to the heads," he
said.
    Krenzler said early planted stands in the north-central and
southwestern parts of the state are probably most vulnerable.
Crops in the panhandle of Oklahoma and Texas are less developed
and have some snow cover protection from the cold, he noted.

States Lines (S.A.) Inc -- have agreed in principle to dispose
of substantially all their remaining operating shipping assets.
    The units have been operating under protection of Chapter
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since last November.
    McLean said U.S. Lines has a letter of intent with CSX
Corp's &lt;CSX> Sea-Land Corp subsidiary to transfer assets of its
Transpacific/Hawaii/Guam Service to Sea-Land.
    McLean said Sea-Land has tentatively agreed to pay 125 mln
dlrs for six vessels, certain port facilities, and various
other equipment used in U.S. Lines' Transpacific service and
theree Lancer class vessels and subsidy rights owned by the two
McLean subsidiaries.
    As previously announced, U.S. Lines (S.A.) will transfer
its South American Service to &lt;Crowley Maritime Corp>'s
American Transport Lines Inc subsidiary in return for a fixed
lease payment for the four Lancer class vessels and a
participation based on American Transport's South American
revenues.
    McLean said the agreement also calls for Crowley to release
U.S. Lines (S.A.) for any damages and unpaid charter hire for
three vessels leased to U.S. Lines (S.A.) by Crowley which have
been returned to Crowley.
    McLean said the minimum lease payments will be seven mln
dlrs and estimated revenue participation during the first four
years at about 16 mln dlrs. In addition, U.S. Lines (S.A.)
subsidiaries in Brazil and Argentina will be sold to American
Transport.
    The company said both agreements in principle have been
approved by directors of the companies involved, but still need
court, regulatory and lender approval.
    McLean said it is requesting the bankruptcy court to
schedule a hearing on its motion to approve the agreements,
adding that the court has granted the company's request to
extend for 90 days the period for the shipping companies to
file a proposed plan of reorganization.
    It said the planned transactions will leave McLean with no
significant shipping assets except 12 New York class vessels,
which are not in operation and are expected to be sold.
    McLean said its shipping units are returning the vessels
operating in foreign commerce to United States ports to permit
the planned transfer to purchasers.
    The company said U.S. Lines will maintain its weekly
service from the U.S. West Coast to Hawaii and Guam until the
vessels are transferred and the transaction is completed.

<BODY>The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)
has proposed stringent limits on the portion of futures trading
that can be conducted between "trading rings," or  affiliated
groups of floor brokers, according to a CME spokesman.
    Violators would be subject to fines of as much as 50,000
dlrs, the exchange said in a letter distributed to its members
earlier this week.
    The proposal is one of the reforms the exchange's Board of
Governors suggested to curb practices that have come under fire
for unfairly limiting competition on the floor. Local traders
claim that trading among broker "rings" violates the
open-outcry system prevailing in the futures markets.
    Limits on ring trading would be applied floor-wide under
the proposal. The other reforms, which address dual trading,
would apply only to the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index
futures pit.
    A debate over dual trading, the practice of trading for
one's own account and filling customer orders, has arisen
because many traders believe it can create a climate for
trading abuses, especially in the extremely volatile stock
index futures pit.
    Adoption of the Board of Governors' reforms hinges on an
April 13 vote of CME members on a membership petition, signed
by several hundred members in February, that would bar all dual
trading at the exchange.
    Defeat of the petition is likely, according to a floor
broker contacted by Reuters, who also said he welcomed the
limits on the "ring" traders. If members reject the petition,
that would open up the way for the Board of Governors' reforms.
    CME President William Brodsky said the need to curb broker
group trading has grown "as the groups have gotten larger." "A
lot of the individuals were losing business because they were
faced with a large-scale competition. The Board began studying
the problem about six months ago.
    Under the proposed reforms, members of a broker rings --
defined as brokers who share brokerage fees, revenues,
expenses, a deck of customer orders or employee salary expenses
-- would be barred from trading more than 15 pct of their
personal trades with each other. Those found in violation would
be subject to fines of up to 50,000 dlrs.
    Broker ring members would also be prohibited from trading
more than 25 pct of customer orders with each other. Fines of
up to 10,000 dlrs would be levied on violators.
    More stringent limits were proposed on individual trading
than customer orders because "we don't want to negatively
impact customer orders," Brodsky said. "On the other hand, the
need to do a personal order is very different."
    Broker associations would also be limited to having no more
than one member serving on an exchange disciplinary or pit
committee.

<BODY>The International Cocoa Organization
(ICCO) council agreed standard price differentials for
different origin cocoas to form part of the buffer stock buying
and selling procedure, consumer delegates said.
    The buffer stock manager will accept offers for different
origin cocoas according to a sliding scale of price
differentials, under which Ghana cocoa will be pegged at a 137
stg premium to Malaysian.
    Thus, if the buffer stock manager was buying cocoa based on
a Malaysian price of 1,200 stg a tonne, he would accept Ghana
offers up to 1,337 stg.
    Differentials were fixed as follows,
 Country       Differential stg/tonne
 Malaysia           0
 Brazil            55
 Ivory Coast       67
 Cameroun          77
 Nigeria          120
 Togo             130
 Ghana            137
    Nigeria's differential is on "landed weight" terms. Shipping
weight terms will be accepted at a 15 stg discount to this
rate.

<BODY>The London Metal Exchange's, LME,
decision to introduce a dollar-denominated aluminium contract,
with the Port of Singapore listed as a delivery point, is a
positive move, physical traders and LME dealers said.
    Earlier this week the LME declared that a 99.70 pct minimum
purity aluminium contract would commence trading on June 1,
1987, alongside its long-established sterling-based 99.50 pct
contract.
    This is the LME's first dollar contract and non-European
delivery point, and the Board and Committee are looking at
Singapore as a delivery point for other contracts.
    Trade sources said the LME's new contract will conform with
existing industry practice, where 99.70 standard re-melt
material, priced in dollars, is most commonly traded.
    The location of a warehouse in Singapore is also a positive
move by the LME, given its ideal location for Australian and
Japanese traders, who would be able to place metal on to
warrant speedily and relatively inexpensively, they said.
    Hedging during the LME ring sessions becomes much simpler
with a dollar contract. At present pre-market trading is almost
exclusively dollar-based, but currency conversions have to be
done during the sterling rings, they added.
    LME ring dealers said the new contract would match more
closely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of the
recent wide backwardations.
    Very little physical business is now done in 99.50 pct
purity metal, nearly all of which is produced in Eastern Bloc
countries, such as Romania.
    The Soviet Union also produces 99.50 pct, but has declined
as an exporter recently, they said.
    Some dealers said the new 99.70 contract may suffer from
liquidity problems initially, as business may continue to
centre on the present good ordinary brand (gob) contract, where
there are many holders of large short positions on the LME.
    But others said the new contract would soon attract trading
interest, given that much 99.70 metal has already been
attracted to the LME's warehouses by backwardations.
    The LME also has a much more viable liquidity base for a
new contract, compared to the Comex market in New York, where
high grade aluminium futures are not particularly active, they
said.
    Thus, it seems likely that the sterling contract will
eventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline. Like
standard zinc, which was superseded by a high grade contract,
gob aluminium will probably be replaced, although the process
in this case may take longer, they added.
    Forming a new contract and establishing a Singapore
warehouse are constructive moves by the LME but backwardations,
which make physical trading difficult, would not totally
disappear as a result, the trade sources said.
    These premiums for prompt metal have become a
semi-permanent feature over the last year, due to increased
business and volatility in traded options, and are presently
around 50 stg.
    Increasingly large granting of option positions has been
taking place. When some of these are declared and exercised at
the end of the relevant month, physical tightness and squeezes
around these dates are commonplace, they said.
    Listing Singapore as a delivery point allows Far Eastern
operators to deliver aluminium into a LME warehouse instead of
having to cover.
    But tightness and backwardations are seen continuing, even
though the LME's new option contracts widen the gap between the
declaration and prompt dates.
    These will be due on the first and third Wednesday of the
month, whereas at present most fall on the 20th and 25th.
    Backwardations will remain while operators continue to
grant options where potential tonnage to be delivered exceeds
aluminium stock levels, an LME option trader said.

rose 0.6 pct in February after being unchanged in January, the

    Between February this year and February, 1986, real

    The rise in February real earnings resulted from a 0.5 pct
increase in average hourly earnings and a 0.6 pct increase in

in the consumer price index, which measures inflation, the

<BODY>Fueled by an earnings-driven bull
market, food stocks are emerging as the big winners, analysts
say.
    "This is an earnings-driven market, and the investor is
homing in on stocks that have visible and predictable earnings
growth," E.F. Hutton food analyst June Page said.
    The food group, whose stocks have underperformed since the
beginning of the year after about five years of growth, seems
to have turned around, DLJ Securities analyst William Leach
agreed.
    The fundamentals remain favorable and may even be enhanced
by the effects of tax reform for companies such as Sara Lee
Corp &lt;SLE>, Quaker Oats Co &lt;OAT>, and General Mills Inc &lt;GIS>,
Page said. These and other food companies are recommended as
aggressive buys on a selective basis by most brokerage houses
surveyed.
    The current economy provides an environment of stable
inflation, interest rates and energy costs, which gives food
companies the flexibility to expand profit margins over a
period of time, Page said. Lower commodity costs allow for
further price flexibility, she added.
    Another plus is that increases in labor and packaging in
the food industry have been minimal, she noted.
    For 1987, Page said E.F. Hutton sees inflation holding
under four pct, oil prices stabilizing at 17 to 18 dlrs a
barrel and interest rates remaining at current levels.
    As a result of new production facilities featuring
sophisticated technology "companies now have a lower breakeven
point because they have enhanced productivity and lower
overhead costs," she said.
    Unit volume growth has accelerated in the past several
years in the food industry due to product segmentation, that
is, iintends to
file for an offering of about two mln shares within the next 30

    It said proceeds would be used for working capital and
other general corporate purposes, including the possible
acquisition of other businesses or additional technology.

<BODY>Premier Yu Kuo-Hua ordered financial
officials to quicken the pace of relaxing foreign exchange
controls and study the possibility of suspending the controls,
a cabinet statement said.
    The statement quoted Yu as telling Finance Ministy and
Central Bank officials the relaxation was needed to help reduce
Taiwan's surging foreign exchange reserves, which reached a
record 53 billion U.S. Dollars this month.
    Finance Minister Robert Chien told reporters his ministry
and the Central Bank would work jointly on new measures to ease
the controls, but he did not give details.
    Yu said the government could maintain the framework of the
foreign exchange controls while finding ways to ease them. The
controls would be used during emergency.
    Taiwan's reserves have resulted largely from its trade
surplus, which hit 15.6 billion dlrs in 1986 and 10.6 billion
in 1985. About 95 pct of the surplus was from Taiwan's trade
with the United States, according to official figures.
    But he said that while easing the controls would help
reduce the reserves, it would not do so substantially in a
short time.
    Economists and bankers said the new decision resulted from
growing pressure from the United States, Taiwan's largest
trading partner, which buys almost half the island's exports.
    Lu Ming-Jen, economic professor at Soochow University, told
Reuters: "The decision came a little bit late. But it was better
than never."
    Ko Fei-Lo, Vice President at First Commercial Bank, said
the government should rapidly relax its foreign exchange
controls and open its market wider to help balance trade with
its trading partners, especially the United States.
    "The liberalisation in both imports and foreign exchange
controls will not only help our trading partners, but also help
our own economic problems," he said.
    He said the mounting foreign exchange reserveshelped boost
Taiwan's money supply by 48.22 pct in the year to end-February.

<BODY>An error interrupted testing of an Ariane
rocket third stage starter motor on Monday but there should be
little or no delay in the launch program, Arianespace said.
    A joint statement from the European Arianespace consortium
and the motor manufacturer Societe Europeenne de Propulsion
(SEP) said that to avoid any risk, the motor had been
dismantled and could not be used in the next launch.
    It had immediately been replaced by another motor and new
tests had begun today.
    "In these conditions, the flight V19 remains scheduled
before the end of June," the statement said.
    Ariane launches have been suspended since an ignition
failure in the third stage motor last May forced controllers to
blow up a rocket in flight.
    SEP has been carrying out a series of nearly 50
simulated-altitude tests on the redesigned starter at its
tightly guarded plant in the town of Vernon, 80 km northwest of
Paris.
    The Arianespace-SEP statement said that during a test on
March 23, a fault in the preparation of the altitude simulation
chamber meant a component of the motor came under abnormal
pressure.
    Arianespace originally hoped to resume launches by February
this year, but a longer-than-expected test program on the new
starter motor forced postponement of the next launch.
    The total orderbook of outstanding launches for the
13-member European Space Agency's Ariane rockets runs to more
than 40 satellites and is worth more than two billion dlrs.
    The Ariane program is the main rival to the United States'
NASA agency in the lucrative satellite launch market. Its
orders have sharply increased largely as a result of the U.S.
Space shuttle disaster in January 1986.

<BODY>Japanese computer chip makers reacted
angrily to news the United States plans to take retaliatory
action against them for allegedly failing to live up to an
agreement on trade in computer microchips.
    Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) Chairman
Shoichi Saba stated: "EIAJ believes that it is premature and
even irrational to attempt an assessment of the impact of the
agreement and our efforts to comply with it only six months
after concluding the agreement."
    "We urge U.S. Governmental authorities to reconsider the
decision made, to evaluate fairly the results of Japanese
efforts in implementing the objectives of the agreement, and to
resist emotional biases," he said.
    Yesterday, Washington announced plans to slap as much as
300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation for
what is sees as Japan's failure to comply with the terms of the
pact.
    The agreement, struck late last year after months of heated
negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips
on world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.
    To salvage the pact, Tokyo has instructed its chip makers
to slash production and has helped establish a multi-lateral
organisation designed to promote chip imports.
    Saba said that Japanese chip companies have pledged three
mln dlrs over the next five years to the new organisation and
expressed regret that no American company has seen fit to join.
    "This suggests that American semiconductor manufacturers may
not be really interested in participating in the Japanese
market," he said.

<BODY>A leading U.S. Banker said the dollar
was likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and an
improvement in the huge American trade deficit would be only
temporary at current world exchange rate levels.
    Kurt Viermetz, Worldwide Treasurer of &lt;Morgan Guaranty
Trust Co>, told Arab currency traders meeting here that the
steady depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough to
rein in U.S. Deficits on a lasting basis.
    Speaking at the 14th annual congress of the Interarab
Cambist Association, Viermetz said an agreement reached last
month among major industrial nations to steady the dollar
around current levels left many questions unanswered.
    "I cannot see any chance for a real turnaround (rise) in the
dollar," Viermetz said. "I believe there is room for a further
fall of five to 10 per cent in 1987."
    The United States, West Germany, Japan, France, Great
Britain and Canada -- G-6 -- agreed in Paris in late February
to stabilise major currencies around current levels.
    The accord came after months of transatlantic argument,
with Tokyo and Bonn claiming Washington's policy of talking the
dollar lower had made life impossible for West German and
Japanese exporters.
    The Paris accord also brought a pause to the continued
slide of the dollar engineered by a meeting in New York in
September 1985 when industrial nations agreed to depress the
value of the currency to help redress global trade imbalances.
    But Viermetz said Morgan Guaranty's economic models showed
that with no further change in exchange rates -- and continued
sluggish growth in West Germany and Japan -- the U.S. Trade
deficit would improve only temporarily.
    He said the deficit might fall to 145 billion dlrs this
year from 165 billion in 1986 and further improve to 120
billion in 1988 but by 1990, it would be back around 160
billion dlrs.
    "This is clearly unacceptable for the monetary authorities
and politicians in Washington," he said.
    Viermetz said it was only natural that markets should
attempt to test the credibility of the Paris accord, struck
when the dollar was trading at about 1.83 marks and 152.50 yen.
    Immediately before the historic 1985 New York agreement or
"Plaza Accord," the dollar had been trading at 2.84 marks and 240
yen.
    Viermetz said he believed major nations in Paris wanted to
see the dollar hold within a "loose range" of 1.75 to 1.90 marks
and 145 to 155 yen, with any attempt to push the U.S. Currency
lower being countered by central bank intervention.
    The dollar ended in New York yesterday at 147.15/25 yen --
its lowest level against the Japanese currency in roughly 40
years. It closed at 1.8160/70 marks.
    Viermetz also said he did not see the U.S. Federal funds
rate falling below six pct for fear of provoking an
uncontrolled fall in the dollar.
    But at the same time, worries about the international debt
crisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 6-3/4
pct since this would increase loan costs to the third world.
    The Middle East foreign exchange conference brings together
more than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the Arab
world and Arab banks in European and U.S. Financial centres.
    Formal discussions, which end today, have also centred on
the role of Arab banks in world financial markets, with bankers
urging them to adapt to a new global trend towards
securitisation of  business.
    Hikmat Nashashibi, President of the Arab Bankers
Association, said Arab banks have to shake off their old
mentality of commercial banking and concentrate more on
investment banking.

Meguerditch Bouldikian called for the establishment of an Arab
fund to assist the Lebanese pound, which has lost more than 80
pct of its value against the dollar since January 1986.
    Bouldikian told an Arab exchange dealers conference the
bank would continue to take measures to defend the currency.
    But he said Lebanon needed foreign support for its
war-battered economy now more than ever before. "We expect a
common effort between the central bank and Arab central banks
and monetary authorities to create an Arab fund to support and
preserve the value of the currency when needed," he said.
    Twelve years of civil war have devastated productive
sectors of the Lebanese economy and created gaping trade and
budget deficits.
    Bouldikian said recent government measures had succeeded in
reducing demand for imports and increasing exports. "These are
encouraging factors, but the war has not ended yet," he said.
    "We believe that with a just political solution acceptable
to all sides, confidence will return and this will benefit the
Lebanese pound and Lebanon."
    In the meantime, he said the central bank had four main
goals:
    1) to use surplus liquidity to finance the budget deficit
    2) to increase the role of commercial banks and non-bank
financing institutions in financing the deficit
    3) to limit the transfer of Lebanese pounds into foreign
currency deposits
    4) to protect the financial health of commercial banks.

disputed oil rights in the Aegean Sea.
    Papandreou was speaking to reporters after briefing

aircraft headed for the Aegean.
    He and other political leaders spoke of qualified optimism
following a statement by Turkish Premier Turgut Ozal last night

    The Prime Minister declined to answer reporters' questions

he thought the suspension would be temporary until the crisis

and to the land border with Turkey at the Evros River.
    But there was no official word on military movements apart
from a comment by the government spokesman that the Greek navy

<BODY>Chinese Vice-Premier Tian Jiyun said
plans to scrap the country's parallel currency, Foreign
Exchange Certificates (FECs), had been postponed due to
objections from foreign businessmen and others.
    But Tian told a news conference the Chinese government
still considered FECs unsatisfactory.
    Asked about the current state of plans to abolish the FECs,
Tian said: "We have decided to postpone the question. As to
whether it will be done in the future, it will be done
according to the evolution of the situation."
    He said many people, including foreign businessmen, had
raised objections to the plan to abolish the certificates, and
added: "It is rather complicated."
    The FECs were introduced in 1980 for use by foreigners in
China. But they now circulate widely among local residents and
there is a big black market in the currency, though it is
theoretically at par with the ordinary Chinese currency,
renminbi.
    Tian said the government still considered that the FECs had
"many demerits and negative influences."
    Bank of China President Wang Deyan told Reuters earlier
this month that he thought it unlikely that the certificates
would be scrapped this year.
    Western diplomats and economists have said the Chinese
authorities are having trouble finding a suitable alternative.
    Vice-Premier Yao Yilin announced at a similar press
conference last year that the FECs would be abolished, saying
the government had decided it was ideologically unacceptable to
have two currencies circulating in China at the same time.

<BODY>Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone sounded
a conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with the
United States over trade in computer microchips.
    "Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by
explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that
need to be corrected," he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as
saying.
    While expressing regret over America's decision to impose
tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said
Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington
to help settle the dispute.
    Government officials said Japan would make a formal request
next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would
probably meet the week after, just days before the April 17
deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect.
    Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan
investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are
dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets.
    Yesterday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300
mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic
goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to
live up to their bilateral chip pact.
    That agreement, hammered out late last year after months of
heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price
chips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips.
    Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatory
than those of his Trade and Industry Minister, Hajime Tamura,
who earlier today said Japan was ready to take "appropriate
measures" if Washington went ahead with the sanctions.
    Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura's
remark and said that his main message was that the two sides
need to talk urgently about the issue.
    But they admitted that Japan was considering taking the
United States to GATT, the Geneva-based international
organization which polices world trade, if Washington imposed
the tariffs.
    Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article
23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), they
said. If that article were invoked, GATT would set up a panel
to consider the legality of the U.S. Action.
    But officials here said they hope that can be avoided. "It
may be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the United
States may lift its decision at an early date," Tamura said.
    In announcing the U.S. Sanctions yesterday, President
Ronald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he had
evidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in world
markets and had opened up its own market to imports.
    Japanese government officials said they are confident they
can make the pact work.
    They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chips
through unregulated distributors has all but dried up after
MITI instructed domestic makers to cut output.
    While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japanese
imports of American chips, MITI officials said that the
ministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens.
    The Ministry recently called on Japan's major chip users,
some of whom are also leading producers, to step up their
purchases of foreign semiconductors.
    A spokesman for one of the companies, Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T>
said his firm would do just that and could announce its plans
in the next week or so. He expects other Japanese companies to
do likewise.

<BODY>Turkey"s standoff with Greece over Aegean
oil rights appeared at an end after the government said it had
been assured Athens would not start prospecting in disputed
waters.
    A Foreign Ministry statement last night hinted Turkey was
claiming victory. A Greek-based international consortium, North
Aegean Petroleum Co., Had given up plans to start searching for
oil in international waters east of Thasos island, it said.
    "In the same way it has been understood that Greece will
also not undertake oil activities outside its territorial
waters," the statement added.
    An Ankara Radio report monitored in London said Foreign
Minister Vahit Halefolu had called on Greece to engage in
dialogue over the dispute. It was impossible to resolve the
dispute by crises, he was quoted as saying.
    "We call on Greece to come and engage in a dialogue with us
- let us find a solution as two neighbours and allies should,"
he said.
    The radio said Halefoglu had briefed the leaders of a
number of the country"s political parties on the latest
developments.
    Turkey sent the survey ship Sismik 1 into the Aegean
yesterday, flanked by warships, to press its case but having
earlier said it would go into disputed waters, declared the
vessel would stay in Turkish areas.
    Prime Minister Turgut Ozal, in London on his way home after
heart surgery in the United States, is expected to receive an
ecstatic welcome from thousands of Turks when he returns today.
    He was in defiant mood last night, telling Turkish radio:
"We can never accept that Greece should confine us to the
Anatolian continent. If there are riches under the sea, they
are for mankind."
    Despite the end of the crisis, Turkish officials
acknowledged that the underlying dispute over delimiting the
continental shelf in the Aegean remained unsolved.
    Turkey alleged that the consortium"s plans would have
infringed the 1976 Berne agreement between the two countries,
which called for a moratorium on any activities until the
delimitation was agreed. Greece earlier this month declared it
considers the accord inoperative.

surface-to-surface missile with technological help from China
and is working with Peking on a longer-range missile capable of

    The British Sunday paper, quoting Iranian sources, said the
shorter-range missile was based on a Chinese version of the
Soviet-made Frog and had been fired at the Iraqi port of Basra.
The missile has a range of 40 miles.
    The other type, similar to the Soviet army"s Scud B with a
range of 180 miles, is at an advanced stage of development,
according to the Observer.
    The development of a longer-range weapon would enable Iran
to strike at many towns and cities on the territory of its
relatively small neighbour.
    Earlier this month, Iran acknowledged it had acquired
Chinese-made Silkworm missiles capable of hitting tankers
carrying crude oil from Arab countries to the West.

raids prevented it from exporting oil.

American army base near Athens as a Greek-Turkish row over oil
rights in the Aegean eased.
    A Turkish research ship which Greece had threatened to
tackle if it sailed into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea kept
to Turkish territorial waters yesterday, avoiding a potential
clash.
    Papandreou expressed qualified optimism after briefing
opposition leaders on Aegean developments early yesterday.
    The Greek government later withdrew Friday's request to
Washington to close down its telecommunications base at Nea

prompted it to make the request were no longer valid.
    Under the terms of the U.S.-Greek bases accord, Greece has
the right to ask for suspension of operations at times when its
national interests are threatened.
    The row in the Aegean erupted after Turkey said it would
search for oil round three Greek islands off its coast
following an announcement from Greece that it planned to drill
east of Thassos island after taking control of a Canadian-led
oil consortium operating in the northern Aegean.
    Turkey accused Greece of breaching the 1976 Berne Agreement
under which both sides agreed to preserve the status quo in the
Aegean until their continental shelf dispute was settled.
Athens says it considers the accord inactive.
    The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it had
received an assurance from Greece that it would not carry out
oil activities outside its territorial waters. Greece declined

<BODY>The Emirates Industrial Bank has
predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states
following higher oil revenues.
    A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, said
total oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from
33.5 billion in 1986.
    The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
    The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil
prices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrain
overall group production.
    These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight
dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs.
    "All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in
the economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected
growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,"
the study said.
    It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher
budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past
recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts.
    The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise
to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year.
    It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combined
trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in
1985.
    The UAE suffered a 19.5 pct drop in gross domestic product
to 77.6 billion dirhams last year from 96.4 billion in 1985, it
added.

economic policies more closely before moving towards their goal
of a unified currency system, the President of the Arab Bankers
Association said.
    Hikmat Nashashibi told a news conference at the end of an
Arab currency traders meeting: "We have to start with
coordination of fiscal policies as a prerequisite for a common
system of currencies ... There is quite a substantial way to go
yet."
    He said only then would a unified Gulf currency system be a
plausible project.
    The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates --  have held a series of meetings this year to
examine linking their currencies to a single peg in a system
which bankers say could be modelled on the European Monetary
System (EMS).
    At present, five currencies are linked either officially or
in practice to the U.S. Dollar, while the Kuwaiti dinar is
pegged to a trade-weighted basket of currencies.
    A common currency system or EMS-style "grid" would, in
theory, foster regional trade by providing a basis for stable
exchange rates, but Nashashibi said inter-Arab trade is at a
very low ebb and capital flows between Gulf states remain
small. "Capital markets in the Arab world are still in their
infancy," he said.
    Nashashibi said lack of experience among Arab banks, a
paucity of financial instruments and a legal framework that
often does not recognise the western banking concept of
interest have hampered the growth of Arab markets.

China valued its good credit rating in the world.
    Vice-Premier Tian Jiyun told a news conference for foreign
journalists the debt, including foreign investment, was 20.6
billion dlrs at end-1986, of which 7.6 billion were in
long-term, low-interest loans.
    "Considering the national economic strength of China and the
scale of its imports and exports, this level of foreign debt
can be sustained by China now and has not developed to a
dangerous point," he said.
    Finance Minister Wang Bingqian said in the budget speech on
Thursday that foreign borrowings in 1987 would be almost double
the 1986 level and nearly six times the 1985 amount.
    Under Chairman Mao Tse-tung's rule from 1949-1976, China
borrowed very little abroad, insisting that nearly all
development be financed from the country's own resources.
    Tian took the opposite view. "It is not enough for us to
rely totally on our own funds and capital (to achieve its
modernisation). We have to have the courageous spirit to borrow
a certain amount of foreign loans," he said.
    He said China must not borrow too much and no more than it
can repay. "China has good credit in terms of foreign borrowing
and we value this good credit," he said.
    Vice Premier Yao Yilin, a former Commerce Minister, told
the same news conference some people said China's foreign debt
was already too much and others said China could increase the
amount.
    "They proceed from their own perspectives to make such
remarks. We must always be clear-headed when we analyse the
situation," he said.

<BODY>Italy is to modify restrictions limiting
the amount of lira cash that can be brought in and out of the
country, the Foreign Trade Ministry said.
    A statement said Foreign Trade Minister Rino Formica has
signed a measure lifting currency regulations that currently
impose a 400,000 lire limit on the value of lira bank notes
that can be brought into Italy. It did not say when the new
measure would come into force.
    In future, there will be no limit to the amount of lira
bank notes both residents and non-residents can bring into
Italy.
    The statement said the 400,000 lire limit would remain for
Italian residents wishing to take cash out of the country, but
non-residents could re-export lira cash if they made
appropriate declarations at customs points.
    It said the lifting of the restrictions "reinforces the

    Around 75 pct of the additional revenue will be used to cut
state debt and 25 pct for public sector investment.
    Of this investment envelope, a total of 800,000 francs will
go towards industrial modernisation, especially of the chemical
sector and and a further 800,000 francs for high-tech
industries such as the aeronautical and electronic sectors, the
Finance Ministry said.
    France's state railways, the SNCF, will receive 1.4 billion

<BODY>A senior Nicaraguan official said a
recent plunge in coffee prices was economically and politically
disastrous for Latin American coffee-producing countries.
    Nicaraguan Foreign Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca
was in London to brief International Coffee Organisation (ICO)
executive board producer members after a meeting last weekend
in Managua attended by eight Latin American coffee producers to
discuss the fall in coffee prices.
    London coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in March, to
1,279 stg from 1,580 stg at end-February.
    Martinez told reporters the price fall since the ICO failed
to agree export quotas on March 1 has had disastrous results on
Latin America, both economically and politically.
    He urged continued negotiations among coffee producers to
pave the way for a coffee export quota agreement by September.
    Coffee export quotas, used to regulate coffee prices under
an International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago
when prices soared in response to a drought in Brazil.
    Central American economic ministers have estimated the
region will lose 720 mln dlrs in foreign exchange earnings in
1987 if coffee prices are not rescued by a quota arrangement,
Martinez said.
    He said ICO quota talks broke down last month because
consumer members lack the political will to fully support
commodity agreements, and because consumers tried to dictate to
producers.

<BODY>Japan is seeking to prevent its computer
chips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scale
trade war, government officials said.
    "We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won't have
an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United
States," a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
official said.
     On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300
mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo's
alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact.
    That agreement, reached last year after heated
negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips
in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.
    Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the
fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the
end of April.
    While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure
the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures
it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure
the trip's success, they said.
    "The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,"
one official told Reuters. "We would very much like to do
something to respond to that."
    In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from
spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the
U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor
makers, not to the government.
    Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an
angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been
forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor
dispute, trade analysts said.
    They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largest
chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the
draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact,
included enforced production cuts.
    The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the
announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties
the government faces in taking further action.
    "Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the
U.S./Japan agreement," said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of the
Electronic Industries Association of Japan.
    He accused the U.S. Of being "irrational." He said the U.S.
Action had made the bilateral chip pact "meaningless."
    Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute
through consultations.
    Japan is expected to send a high-level official to
Washington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not to
go ahead with the tariffs on April 17.
    Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industry
plans to step up purchases of U.S. Chips and to propose a joint
investigation into Washington's allegations of chip dumping.

<BODY>The U.S. Expects more harmonious
talks than usual during French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's
first official visit this week as frequently rancorous disputes
between the two countries begin to fade.
    "The Libyan bombing is a thing of the past, the trade war
didn't happen and we have reached reasonably good cooperation
on terrorism," one U.S. Official told Reuters.
    "It looks like a reasonably harmonious visit in prospect,
more harmonious than usual."
    Since taking office a year ago, Chirac has been obliged to
deal with a series of potentially serious disputes with the
United States.
    During the U.S. Bombing of alleged terrorist targets in
Libya last April, France refused to allow British-based U.S.
Planes to overfly its territory, forcing them to take a
circuitous route. That angered Washington.
    The U.S. Officials, who asked not to be identified, said a
year ago Washington felt the French were not taking strong
enough action against terrorism. "Now they are. We're pleased
and they are pleased that we are pleased," one said.
    More recently, a dispute over U.S. Access to the grain
markets of Spain and Portugal after they joined the European
Community  threatened to become a trade war.
    In retaliation for what Washington saw as deliberate
Community moves to exclude U.S. Grain, the United States was
poised to impose swingeing tariffs on European Community food
imports and a major trade war was averted at the last minute.
    Last week, the forces of President Hissene Habre of Chad,
supported, trained and armed by Paris and Washington, scored a
major success by pushing Libyan troops out of their last bases
in northern Chad.
    A French official added: "There is also a common interest in
getting Japan to cut its trade surplus with the rest of the
world by opening up its markets."
    Although relations have improved markedly between the two
countries, many irritants remain. At the top of the list is the
Community's common agricultural policy (CAP).
    To Washington, as one official put it, "CAP is the root of
all evil" in international food trade because it subsidises
farmers and sells vast amounts of excess produce at below world
prices, thereby eating into U.S. Markets.

<BODY>Iraqi Foreign Minister Tareq Aziz was
quoted as saying Iran has attacked several ships with
land-based missiles sited at the Strait of Hormuz.
    The U.S. Announced recently Iran had emplaced Chinese-made
"Silkworm" anti-ship missiles with the range to cover the entire
width of the 24-mile-wide strait at the Gulf's mouth.
    Aziz said in an interview with al-Thawra newspaper that
leaders of Gulf Arab states had told him of the existence of
the missiles, which he said had been in place for many months.
    "They briefed me with their details and we know that the
Iranians used them several times to attack ships belonging to
Arab states in the Gulf, sailing in the waterway," he said.
    This is the first time any person of authority has said
Iran, Iraq's enemy in the 6-1/2-year-old Gulf war, had fired
the missiles in anger.
    A British naval source in the Gulf said last week Iran had
fired one test missile against a hulk in the strait.
    About 120 ships have been attacked in the Gulf by both
belligerents since January last year.
    Aziz said the U.S. Had announced the existence of the
missiles so late after their arrival as part of its efforts to
neutralise the effects of the secret U.S. Arms sale to Iran.
    "The missiles existed in the Gulf for many months ... But
they became a serious topic for America and the West only after
the failure of the Iranian invasion plan (against the south
Iraqi city of Basra) and as a balloon to cover up the Irangate

marks in 1986 from 313.7 mln in 1985, new majority shareholder
Aachener und Muenchener Beteiligungs-AG &lt;AMVG.F>, AMB, said.
    But total operating and extraordinary profits, including
earnings from currency and securities trading on the bank's own
account and earnings from the sale of holdings in other firms,
were more than double the previous year's level, AMB said.
    BfG's 1986 accounts were included in a prospectus for AMB's
capital increase, which is to finance the insurance company's
acquisition of 50 pct plus one share of BfG.
    Despite the fall in partial operating profits, BfG paid an
unchanged 20 mln marks into open reserves and transferred an
unchanged 80 mln marks to its trade union holding company,
AMB has acquired the majority stake.
    The bank has said its business last year suffered from the
turbulence around the troubled trade-union-owned housing
concern Neue Heimat.
    AMB said the 500 mln mark drop in BfG's business volume to
50.1 billion marks affected the interest surplus.
    The interest surplus, which fell to 897.9 mln marks from
981.1 mln, was also depressed by the 0.1 point fall in the
interest margin to 1.9 pct.
    A rise in the surplus on commission to 208.8 mln marks from
188.1 mln was not enough to compensate for this.
    The rise in total operating profits enabled BfG to step up
risk provisions, with country risks particularly emphasised
because of the continuing difficulties of some countries.
    Disclosed risk provisions, which under West German
accounting rules do not necessarily reflect the full amount,
rose to 736.3 mln marks from 224.0 mln.
    BfG's parent credit volume eased to 32.63 billion marks in
1986 from 33.51 billion. Foreign debtors accounted for 24 pct
of this credit volume, and Latin American debtors accounted for
14.7 pct of total lending to foreigners.
    BfG posted extraordinary earnings from the sale of 25.01
pct of &lt;Volksfuersorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG>, 74.9
pct of &lt;BSV Bank fuer Sparanlagen und Vermoegensbildung AG> and
five pct of &lt;Allgemeine Hypothekenbank AG>. The sale was linked
to AMB's acquisition of a majority of BfG.
    These sales show up as 494.2 mln marks from profit transfer
agreements and 326.5 mln from writing back risk provisions.

<BODY>The Jeddah-based Islamic Development
Bank (IDB) said in an annual report its loans during the last
Islamic year fell 24 pct due to world economic recession.
    Total financing approved by the bank for projects, trade,
and technical and special assistance fell to 756.9 mln Islamic
dinars in the year ended September 4, 1986, from 1,001.4 mln
the previous year.
    "Due to a general recession in the world economy, the demand
for development funds was low and there was a scarcity of
processable projects in most member countries during 1406
(September 1985-86)," the report said.
    It said a steep decline in oil prices had led to a major
transfer of resources from oil-producing countries to
industrial nations.
    "The oil exporting member nations of the IDB faced a major
adjustment problem arising from a sizable decline in oil prices
and loss of export earnings, affecting their position as
potential suppliers of capital," the report said.
    Project financing and technical assistance loans fell to
175.7 mln Islamic dinars in the year ended last September from
269.4 mln the previous year.
    The report said although there was a reduction in foreign
trade financing loans in the past year due to a sharp decline
in the price of oil and various primary commodities, the
quantity financed in physical terms of imports was higher.
    Foreign Trade financing declined to 572.8 mln dinars from
668.2 million dinars the previous year. Disbursements of loans,
including previously-approved loans, fell to 557.2 mln dinars
from 783.9 mln.
    The Bank in 1986 decided to establish a fund under the name
"IDB Unit Trust" to introduce and market financial instruments in
line with the principles of Islam, the report said.
    "This experience will provide a foundation for the floating
of other financial instruments in the near future through which
the bank expects to mobilise even larger resources," the report
said.
    The IDB was established by the 46-member Islamic Conference
Organisation and opened in October 1975.

<BODY>The USSR will hold local council
elections on June 21 at which voters in some districts will
have a choice of candidates as part of an experiment in
electoral reform, the Tass News Agency said.
    The official agency said yesterday the selected districts,
still to be chosen, would have a slate of several candidates,
not all of whom could be elected, and voters would strike out
the names of those they did not support.
    Tass said candidates would have to win support from more
than 50 pct of registered constituents to win seats.
    Voting is compulsory in the Soviet Union.
    In the past, official returns for elections at most levels
in the Soviet government system have recorded 99 to 100 pct
support for all candidates. Voters simply dropped the official
ballot paper with the single candidate's name into an urn.
    Tass said districts chosen for the experiment would return
several deputies rather than a single representative to local
council bodies.
    The announcement followed pledges on electoral reform by
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, campaigning to revitalise
confidence in the communist system after what he has described
as a period of stagnation.

soon settle their trade dispute over semiconductors, U.S.
Commerce secretary Malcolm Baldrige said on television.
    Baldrige, referring to the U.S.-Japan trade agreement on
semiconductors, said: "Their government wants to live up to it.
Their industries haven't been doing it, and I think we'll have
a good settlement to spare both sides."
    "I think the Japanese understand full well that they haven't
lived up to this commitment," he said.
    He added: "I do not think there will be a trade war at all."
    On Friday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300
mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods from April 17,
because of Tokyo's failure to observe the agreement.
    The officials said the tariffs would be ended as soon as
Japan started adhering to the agreement. But they said there
was little chance Japan could react quickly enough to avert the
higher tariffs.
    Baldrige said the Reagan administration hoped the strong
U.S. Action against Japan would convince Congress to tone down
protectionist trade legislation now being drafted.
    He denied the action had been taken for that reason.

<BODY>A top level political reshuffle
following the January removal of Communist Party chief Hu
Yaobang will take place at a party conference later this year,
Vice-Premier Yao Yilin said Saturday.
    Yao told a news conference Zhao Ziyang would go on holding
the jobs of Premier and acting Communist Party chief until the
13th party congress, due to be held by October.
    Yao gave the news conference in the Great Hall of the
People along with Vice-Premiers Li Peng and Tian Jiyun, the two
main contenders to succeed Zhao as Premier.
    Western diplomats say Li, a technocrat who studied in the
Soviet Union, is the most likely successor.
    Li appeared to go out of his way to deny any special
sympathy with Moscow. In answer to questions, he said he had
never met Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev when both studied in
the Soviet Union in the 1950s and had since met him on only two
occasions, both of which had been reported in the news media.
    Asked what China could learn fromn the Soviet economic
system, Li said the main lesson was to avoid excessive
centralism and rigid control over economic activities.
    "We do not totally reject the planned economy, but we are
opposed to rigid control in the planned economy which hampers
initiative and enthusiasm of the grassroots enterprise," Li
said.
    On Taiwan, Yao repeated Chinese policy of not ruling out
force to regain the nationalist-ruled island, but did not
repeat an official statement earlier this week that the goal
was to achieve reunification by the year 2000. "As for
reunification, it is our hope that it will be achieved through
peaceful means, but we have not eliminated the possibility of
taking non-peaceful means to achieve that process," he said.

of state-owned &lt;Everbright Holding Co> of Peking, which has had
a turnover of 500 mln dlrs since it was set up three years ago
under the chairmanship of Wang Guangying, the paper said.
    A Western banker said the creation of the new firm is a
further step in making China's banking more competitive and
breaking down the monopolies that existed previously.
    He said the scope of the new firm will be similar to that
of state-owned &lt;China International Trust and Investment Corp>

<BODY>Poland's communist government raised
food, fuel and energy prices but said it had taken an economic
risk by reducing the scale of the increases under pressure from
the country's official trade unions.
    A communique broadcast on Saturday evening said food prices
would rise on average by 9.3 pct, petrol, gas and electricity
by 25 pct and coal by 50 pct.
    The immediate increases will be followed by a rise of 10
pct in the cost of meat from April 1. Some postal charges will
go up 100 pct next month and rail and bus fares by 30 pct in
October.
    The government said its annual plan for the economy had
specified a 13 pct increase in food prices this year.
    "Economic reasoning calls for greater price rises than those
which have been announced ... The government has taken an
economic risk in accepting a portion of the trades unions'
demands," the communique said.
    The National Trade Union Alliance (OPZZ), which claims
seven million members, warned earlier this month it would fight
efforts to impose the original range of price rises. It said
the rises would badly affect the lower paid and the old,
despite government pledges to protect their purchasing power.
    Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, whose banned organisation
has been replaced by the OPZZ, condemned the increases in front
of a crowd of 1,500 cheering supporters at St Brygida's Roman
Catholic Church in the Baltic port of Gdansk.
    "For the first time in six years (since Solidarity was
banned), I say enough. For the first time, I am decidedly
against. I am against price rises as being the only sign of
reform," Walesa said.
    "I am for reforms. I favour the reforms which (Soviet leader
Mikhail) Gorbachev is carrying out  ... But I am not in favour
of make-believe reforms," he said.

    Poindexter resigned as head of the National Security

disclosed he was aware part of the profits from the arms sales
were diverted to contra rebels in Nicaragua.
    The report in Time quoted unnamed friends of Poindexter's

kept the president adequately informed.
    "Indeed, he is likely to testify that on at least two

the arms deal with Iran," Time said.
    Reagan has repeatedly denied he knew anything about the

and take other action if GenCorp refuses to discuss a 2.3
billion dlr takeover bid.
    General Acquisition Co, a partnership of Wagner and Brown
and AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG>, reiterated in a statement sent to
GenCorp on Friday that it was willing to negotiate its earlier
offer of 100 dlrs a share for the tire, broadcasting, plastics
and aerospace conglomerate.
    Analysts have speculated GenCorp could fetch at least 110
to 120 dlrs per share if broken up.
    GenCorp officials declined to comment on the statement, but
a spokesman reiterated a request to shareholders to wait until
the board renders an opinion before making a decision on the
offer. GenCorp has said a statement would be made on or before
the company's annual meeting on Tuesday.
    General Acquisition said the board could not carry out its
duties to shareholders and make an informed decision until it
has, "... Explored with us the ways in which our offer can be
revised to provide greater value to your shareholders."
    General Acquisition added it was aware the board may be
reviewing alternative transactions, which might provide GenCorp
shareholders with a payment other than cash.
    "If that is the case, you should recognise that our
additional equity capital may very well enable us to offer cash
and securities having greater value than GenCorp could provide
in any similarly structured transaction," it said.
    It added GenCorp's board had an obligation to present any
alternative proposal to shareholders in a way that allowed
competing offers.
    General Acquisition requested it be given a chance to bid
on a competitive and fair basis before any final decision was
made on any other buyout proposal.
    The statement repeated the request GenCorp remove a "poison
pill" preferred share purchase rights to shareholders, making
any takeover more expensive.
    It said it might take legal action, or seek the support of
shareholders in calling a special meeting to replace the board
and consider other proposals.

<BODY>The Finance Ministry is trying to
eliminate technical obstacles so as to encourage purchases of
Japanese Treasury bills by foreign governments and central
banks, in order to increase overseas holdings of yen assets, a
senior Finance Ministry official said.
    The official declined to give details but securities
sources said they expect the 16 pct withholding tax on T-bills
to be repaid immediately when governments and central banks buy
bills. The current practice of filing tax redemption claims is
time consuming, they said.
    Securities houses here have had difficulty selling
six-month debt-financing paper, called tankoku, to overseas
governments and central banks because of the tax system and the
Bank of Japan's book entry system, which demands the accounts
be kept with the houses rather than by the Bank.
    Tankoku, introduced in February 1986, were designed as a
key short-term instrument to promote internationalization of
the yen. But since the introduction of a complicated book-entry
system for bill purchases in January 1986, foreign governments
and central banks have shied away from buying the bills, the
sources said.
    Foreign governments and central banks are therefore
expected to be allowed to hold their accounts at the Bank of
Japan, the securities sources said.
    Relevant measures are likely to be announced at the next

rain to sustain the 1987 crop, an Australian Sugar Producers

    The industry is not as worried as it was two weeks ago, but

effect the dry weather will have on the size of the crop, which
is harvested from around June to December.
    He said frequent but light falls in the areas that are
short of moisture, such as Mackay, mean they really only need
about three days of the region's heavy tropical rains to
restore normal moisture to the cane.
    But rainfall in the next two or three weeks will be crucial
to the size of the crop in the dry areas, he said.

might be in a month without some good falls," he said.

<BODY>Japan is becoming dangerously isolated
again as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated by
Japanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth,
officials and businessmen from around the world said.
    As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen,
making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments
grit their teeth harder, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
there was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise.
    The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by
both sides over the key Maekawa report of April, last year.
    The document was prepared by a private committee formed by
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of
Japan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop friction
due to its large trade surpluses, Japan must "make a historical
transformation in its traditional policies on economic
management and the nation's lifestyle. There can be no further
development for Japan without this transformation."
    Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have
looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the
Japanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term
prospects of totally transforming their economic habits.
    The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese
prevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to
raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to
the U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral
semiconductor pact.
    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to
block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese
placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid
by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic
telecommunications joint venture.
    On Friday, European currency dealers said European central
banks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might
leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen.
    Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group
Keidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory
views last November when he visited the European Community.
"Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I
found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe
was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the
results of the Maekawa report," he said.
    "We explained that the process of restructuring the economy
away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between
domestic and external demand...Would take time," Saito said.
    Saito's words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial
Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said "I
only know that your government, under the leadership of
Maekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less
outward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa
report which has attracted the most attention in Europe."
    And Europeans and Americans want quick action. "A far better
answer than protectionism would be structural change within the
Japanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And
we hope to see changes occur in the near future," visiting
Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March.
    Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the
fault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea of
change in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials.
    Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business
leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade
problem.
    "We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the
Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,"
said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.
    "The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it
is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their
labour," said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of
Shearson Lehman Brothers.
    Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.
    Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as
fast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled
the country asking about this issue.
    He said People mentioned many things in line with the
spirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and
steel industries.
    A major misunderstanding is that the private report was
government policy. Europeans are confused about this,
underlined by von Moltke's reference to the "leadership" of the
Maekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last
September's government programme of new economic measures.
"Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out
that the government has put its signature to a programme
designed to implement the report," the ambassador said.

    The package, guaranteed by the parent firm, &lt;Ssangyong

loan, a five mln dlr revolving letter of credit facility and an
18.3 mln dlr bonding facility. The three year loan carries
interest at 1/2 point over three or six month Singapore
interbank offered rate (Sibor). The LC facility costs 10 basis
points over Sibor and the bonding facility 50 basis points.
    The facility is being lead managed by Hongkong and Shanghai

Scotia, Gulf International Bank, Istituto Bancario San Paolo di
Torino, National Bank of Kuwait, Standard Chartered Asia Ltd
and Sumitomo Finance (Asia) Ltd. Co-managers are Australian

    A Wardley spokesman said the loan was well received by
international banks which have a keen appetite for increasingly
scarce Korean assets. The loan was approved by the Korean
Finance Ministry because it is for use outside Korea and will
not raise the country's indebtedness, he said.

<BODY>Indonesia has minimised the economic
impact of falling oil prices, kept inflation within limits and
boosted exports, Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said.
    Indonesia was badly hit by last year's steep plunge in
crude prices, which cut revenue from oil exports by half.
    But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as telling
President Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct in
the financial year ending tomorrow, against around 4.3 pct the
previous year.
    Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct, he said,
although he did not give complete figures.
    The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to general
elections next month in Indonesia, a major producer of rubber,
palm oil, tin, timber and coffee.
    Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of the
appreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark against
the dollar, which increased Indonesia's debt repayments.
    He said the economy would have suffered more from the world
economic recession if the government had not devalued the
rupiah by 31 pct last September.
    In an editorial on the economic outlook, the Jakarta Post
said the government must press ahead with measures to
deregulate the economy to help boost non-oil exports.
    The English-language daily said bigger export earnings were
needed to finance not only imports but also the country's
growing foreign debt, estimated at around 37 billion dlrs.
    "About 50 pct of our foreign debt obligations fall due
within the next three to five years and will steadily increase
the debt servicing burden," the paper said.
    However, end-investors were seen bargain hunting in
expectation of a further yen interest rate decline, dealers
said.
    Most dealers were cautious in the face of the dollar's
nosedive today and the possibility of a U.S. Interest rate
rebound to halt further dollar depreciation.
    A 4.7 pct coupon and volume of 1,400 billion yen for the
April 10-year bond proposed by the Finance Ministry this
afternoon were taken favourably by the market.

would make a 244 mln stg agreed bid for &lt;Superdrug Stores Plc>
valuing the company's shares at about 696p each.
    The offer would be made on the basis of 17 new Woolworth
ordinary shares for every 20 in Superdrug.
    Woolworth said it had received acceptances from the holders
of 61 pct of Superdrug shares.
    The bid is Woolworth's second attempt in recent months to
acquire a retail chemist chain. Earlier this year it negotiated
a possible bid for &lt;Underwoods Plc> buit the talks were broken

<BODY>The Japanese government appears to have
little new to offer to settle a dispute with the U.S. Over
computer chips, trade analysts and government officials said.
    The U.S. Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300
mln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the U.S., In
retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to keep a pact on the
microchip trade signed last September.
    A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters "Japan has done
what it can, and now we must persuade the United States to wait
for those steps to take effect."
    The U.S. Alleges that, in defiance of the September
agreement, Japan is still selling microchips at below cost in
non-U.S. Markets and refusing to open Japan further to U.S.
Chip sales. U.S. Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17.
     Analysts noted Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) has already ordered chipmakers to cut
production in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in
third countries at non-regulated prices.
    "I'm not sure MITI can do much more than it has," said
Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards.
    A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to call
for production cuts beyond those already sought, although it
would continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods.
    Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said they
would consider buying more U.S. Chips. But a Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase in
imports was not likely.
    Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit if
the United States did implement the tariffs, which would be
levied on consumer electronics products rather than on
microchips themselves.
    "If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time,
there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States,"
said Tom Murtha, analyst at James Capel and Co.
    "The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be
stopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will be
delayed for another year," he said.
    Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry by
stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japan
for semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here.
    "The American approach is full of contradictions," Jardine
Fleming's Edwards said.
    "If they want to expand (U.S.) exports, the last thing they
want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that
hurts the final market," Edwards said.
    But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S.
Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but also
frustration with Japan's vast trade surplus. Some analysts
argued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may have
to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact.
    Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd,
said "The major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic
economy and move away from an export-dependent economy."

<BODY>Remarks by Japan's Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone that last month's G-6 meeting agreed to
stabilize the dollar above 150 yen have come too late to
influence currency trading, dealers said.
    After Nakasone's statement the dollar rose to 146.40/50 yen
from an initial low of 144.20/40 and New York's Friday finish
of 147.15/25. But the rebound was largely on short-covering,
they said.
    "I think (Nakasone's) desperate," said a U.S. Bank foreign
exchange manager.
    Nakasone told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament
that Japan and other industrialized nations committed
themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above
150 yen.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee
that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And
West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar
fell below 150 yen.
    "His (Nakasone) remarks should have been made and should
have had a bigger influence when the dollar was still above 150
yen," said P.S. Tam of Morgan Guaranty Trust.
    Tam said the dollar has hit short-term chart targets  and
is likely to rebound. But he warned of another dip to below 145
yen.
    Dealers said the worsening trade relations between the U.S.
And Japan will continue to depress the dollar.
    The trade issue has now become a political issue since the
Reagan Administration is facing uproar in Congress over
th3pYgks in cutting the country's 169.8 billion dlr trade

<BODY>Japanese securities houses and banks
are eager to enter the market for lead-management of mark
eurobonds when the ban on Japanese institutions is lifted, but
the entry may be difficult, Japanese bankers said.
    Most Japanese securities houses and banks established here
said they have concrete plans to enter lead-management
business, as soon as terms are cleared, probably this year.
    Japan's largest bank, The Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd, is also
considering expanding its business here, bankers said.
    Japanese banks were excluded from lead management of mark
eurobonds when the Bundesbank opened that market to foreign
banks in May 1985, due to the lack of reciprocity for German
banks in the Japanese market.
    Last year, the Japanese began a slow opening by granting
West German banks investment licences.
    Pressure on Tokyo stepped up last week when U.K. Government
sources said Britain may revoke the licences of some Japanese
banks and securities firms operating in London when they come
up for renewal if progress is not made towards opening Japan's
markets to foreign competition.
    A spokesman for the Dai-Ichi Kangyo representative office
here said the bank was naturally considering options such as
expanding its mark securities trading operations to Frankfurt.
    Sources at the bank's London branch said the bank was
already seriously planning such a move.
    Expanding secondary operations would also improve the
placement capacity of Japanese houses intending to move into
lead management of mark eurobonds.
    But even Japanese banks already established in secondary
markets here face a host of problems in lead management. One is
finding borrowers.
    One banker at Nikko Securities Co Ltd's The Nikko
Securities Co (Deutschland) GmbH said the cost of mark issues
may be too high for some Japanese firms.
    "For the moment, for Japanese borrowers, marks are
expensive," he said. Many prefer Swiss francs or eurodollars.
    A Japanese borrower with a five-year equity warrant
eurodollar bond issued at 2-1/2 pct can now swap into domestic
yen rates of one pct. But mark swap opportunities are limited.
    In addition, many Japanese companies are committed already
to large German banks.
    To avoid souring relations with German banks they now
cooperate with, Japanese houses may prefer finding borrowers so
far not seen in the mark sector.
    Names may include Sanyo Electric Co Ltd and Nishimatsu
Construction Co Ltd, which both count Yamaichi Securities Co
Ltd as their house bank, or Hokkaido Electric Power Co Inc,
which recently gave a presentation here with the Industrial
Bank of Japan's unit here.
    Japanese banks are also faced with finding local personnel,
which is not easy. "They are definitely going to have a manpower
problem," one Swiss banker said.
    Swiss and American banks had no trouble attracting top
German managers. But Japanese cultural differences will be
harder for Germans to overcome. Success may depend on whether
Japanese parents allow German subsidiaries independence to
operate without interference.
    Once established, more problems are expected if extra
competition shaves margins.
    Extra competition could cut management fees in the mark
sector. Separate management and underwriting fees common here
may also be eroded, which now make German underwriting business
profitable compared with other centres.
    A few banks are unsure if they really want to get involved
in the business. "I don't think Sumitomo has 100-pct concrete
plans at this moment unless there is a new development," a
banker at the West German commercial branch of Sumito Bank Ltd
in Duesseldorf said.
    Apart from the commercial branch in Duesseldorf Sumitomo
has a rep office in Frankfurt, but both are primarily engaged
in commercial banking. If Sumitomo were to set up a securities
operation, it would have to set up a full subsidiary, he said.

    "Belief is growing that freight rates will not decline

Argentina may fall to 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes from an

<BODY>BASF AG said
the volatile currency situation last year, particularly the
fall of the dollar, led to sharp drops in turnover denominated
in marks and to price reductions for exports from domestic
production.
    But in a statement accompanying year-end figures, the group
said it expected satisfactory business development over the
next months. "At the moment we do not expect any extraordinary
influences such as there were last year," it said. Orders in
hand and incoming orders were steady at a high level.
    BASF reported 13.6 pct lower 1986 world group pre-tax
profit at 2.63 billion marks compared to 1985.
    The unusual situation on the crude oil market last year
also produced a clear sales slide in the oil and gas sector and
forced price declines for petrochemical products, BASF said.
    The fall in pre-tax profit corresponded to the losses on
stocks in the oil and gas sector at the beginning of 1986. In
the parent company, the positive earnings development
continued, it said, where pre-tax profit rose by 3.2 pct to
1.97 billion marks. The decline in parent company turnover was
balanced out by increased capacity use and price declines in
raw materials. 
    In 1986, world group turnover was off 8.8 pct at 40.47
billion marks compared to 1985, BASF said. Parent turnover fell
8.5 pct to 18.72 billion.
    Turnover increases, with the exceptions of the sectors fine
chemicals and informations systems, had only been achieved in
those areas widened last year through acquisition in 1985.
    Results from these had been taken only partly into the
fourth quarter of that year but fully included in 1986 data.
    So far in the current year, the investment volume of the
parent company and the world group is exceeding that in 1986,
BASF said, without giving concrete figures.

<BODY>Bahrain is introducing a new domestic
money market regime to provide dinar liquidity aid centred on
the island's newly launched treasury bill programme.
    The Bahrain Monetary Agency has issued a circular to all
commercial banks outlining a new policy from April 1 which
gives liquidity aid through sale and repurchase agreements in
treasury bills, or through discounting them.
    The circular, released officially to Reuters, said current
arrangements for providing liquidity aid will no longer be
valid except "in quite exceptional circumstances."
    Under the current system, the agency provides the island's
20 commercial banks with dinar liquidity by means of short-term
swaps against U.S. Dollars and, less frequently, by short-term
loans secured against government development bonds.
    "The agency considers that it is now appropriate to replace
these operations with short-term assistance based on Government
of Bahrain treasury bills," the circular to banks states.
    The agency said it will repurchase treasury bills with a
simultaneous agreement to resell them to the same bank at a
higher price which will reflect an interest charge.
    The agency said it envisages the repurchase agreements will
normally be for a period of seven days.
    Bahrain launched a weekly tender for two mln dinars of
91-day treasury bills in mid-December last year and has since
raised a total of 26 mln dinars through the programme.
    Bahrain's commercial banks are currently liquid and have
been making little use of the traditional dollar swaps offered
by the agency. But banking sources said the new regime from
April 1 will mean banks cannot afford not to hold treasury
bills in case they need funds from the central bank.
    Banking sources said more than half of the 20 banks hold
treasury bills, although the need by others to take up paper
could increase demand at weekly tenders and push down allotted
yields slightly.
    Last week's yield was six pct, although the programme had
started at the end of last year with rates as low as 5.60 pct.
    Banking sources said the cost of liquidity through
repurchase accords will not differ much from that on dollar
swaps. But a bank using dollars to obtain liquidity would
foresake interest on the U.S. Currency while the underlying
treasury bill investment is unaffected in a repurchase accord.

    Japan imported 128,089 tonnes of Brazilian beans in

    The sources said Brazilian beans were cheaper than U.S.

there were concerns about deliveries from Brazil in the near

June, 36,000 for June, and 31,000 for late June/early July

    As a result of the large volumes of Brazilian beans
purchased, Japanese crushers will buy a total of only 150,000
tonnes of U.S. Beans for May shipment. Some 100,000 of this

<BODY>A maximum budget deficit of 2.5 billion
dlrs for fiscal 1987/88 ending June 30 is needed if financial
markets are to be impressed with the government's resolve to
tackle Australia's economic problems, Westpac Banking Corp
    This compares with the budgeted deficit of 3.5 billion dlrs
for the current 1986/87 year although the market expects the
actual shortfall to be some 500 mln dlrs higher.
    In its latest Economic Review, Westpac said powerful
arguments could be advanced for eliminating the deficit
altogether next year or even budgeting for a modest surplus.
    Westpac said such a policy would deliver the message the
government was determined to face deep-seated economic
problems. But it said it would be a great deal to expect of a
government in what was probably an election year.
    It said even a relatively minor cut in the deficit would
require some unpleasant decisions, noting a repeat of the
1986/87 budget's zero real growth in spending would only bring
the deficit to about 4.3 billion dlrs.
    A cut of greater than two pct in real terms was needed if a
2.5 billion dlr deficit was to be achieved and this required
some radical surgery to existing programs, the bank said.
    Westpac said the government's mid-May mini-budget provided
an opportunity for bold measures, both in relation to the size
of the government's role in the economy and the principles
governing that activity, notably indexation of outlays.
    It said official figures show 93 pct of outlays in some way
indexed, hard to justify when living standards outside the
public sector were being eroded.
    In current circumstances, the alternative to fiscal
discipline is the sure road to bigger external debts, further
currency depreciation, a boost to inflation and, ultimately,
capital flight, the bank said.

approval from the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to
slash production to about half of total capacity for one year,
effective April 1, industry sources said.
    The approval follows an act of parliament passed last week
designed to help the industry regroup and shed 20 pct of
capacity by March 31, 1988, Transport Ministry officials said.
    The cartel, comprising 33 yards capable of constructing
ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes, will limit newbuilding

<BODY>The Philippines' restructuring of 13.2
billion dlrs of foreign debt will provide a welcome boost for
the economy, but last Friday's accord with the country's
12-bank advisory committee does not imply an overnight boom,
bankers and businessmen polled by Reuters said.
    "The successful negotiations form an important piece in the
mosaic," Christian Roeher, Secretary-General of the European
Chamber of Commerce, said. "Now is really the time for the
government to start implementing its ideas. There has been a
lot of talking and loud thinking."
    Business leaders said the 17-year rescheduling of
commercial bank debt would give President Corazon Aquino some
badly-needed breathing space, but warned her government was
still in the midst of political consolidation.
    "There is a lot of interest among foreign investors in the
country, but now they are waiting to see what happens in the
congressional and local elections later this year," said
American Chamber of Commerce president George Drysdale.
    The government is serious about getting down to work, but
there are many individual agendas for growth and no consensus.
But each step brings a unanimity of opinion closer, he said.
    Aurelio Periquet, President of the Philippine Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, told Reuters the debt accord had
positively translated the international banking community's
confidence in the country's economy and Aquino's government.
    "This government needs less pressure and more time and
happily our creditors seem to see it that way," he said. "This
accord may not result in an immediate boom, but at least it
enhances the image of the country for foreign investors."
    But Periquet said domestic and foreign investments fell
short of targets in 1986. "The accord does not solve all our
problems," he added.
    Periquet said the question of political stability no longer
worried Filipino businessmen, who had already started expanding
existing businesses or investing in new areas.
    "A number of us have already put in new money and there are
plans for the export market," he said. "President Aquino has
shown her ability to pull the nation out of one crisis after
another."
    Roeher said foreign investment would probably be held back
until after the congressional polls in May and the local
elections in August. "The two elections will probably have a
more decisive effect on the way business reacts," he said.
    "Some foreign companies are not waiting, but they are more
the exception than the rule," Roeher said.
    He said it was important the government ensure the creation
of more jobs was not just a transitory development.
    "The absorption of enormous aid given to the Philippines is
also poor. A lot of it has not been put to use. The government
should act without further delay to absorb the 1.7 billion dlrs
of development aid it will receive in 1987," he said.
    A foreign banker close to the debt negotiations said he did
not foresee any real boom until 1989.
    "The problem is that Aquino has inherited her political
system from (former President Ferdinand) Marcos," the banker
said. "There is still a clamour for the sharing of benefits,
different sectors claiming their rights and duties. If they go
too fast there could be another bust two years down the road."
    Businessman Raul Concepcion, whose brother Jose is the
country's trade and industry minister, said everyone could
heave a sigh of relief. "Now that the debt agreement is out of
the way, our economic and financial officials can concentrate
on their work, like increasing government revenue and
efficiency," he said.

<BODY>Sri Lanka will uproot rubber trees that
are more than two years old and affected by the leaf disease
corynespora, the head of the government's Rubber Research
Institute told Reuters.
    Rodney De Mel said affected trees less than two years old
would undergo base-budding -- attaching a clone as close as
possible to the trunk's base and cutting off the top of the
tree once the bud has taken. Uprooted or base-budded trees
mature later, causing an output loss estimated at 350 kilos per
hectare from the sixth year when they begin producing.
    About 7,000 acres are planted with the high yielding RIC
103 variety, the clone afflicted by corynespora.
    Only about 2,000 acres are affected by the disease, which
causes leaves to fall off, De Mel said.
    Sri Lanka has 508,000 acres planted with rubber trees.
    De Mel said the disease was detected in nurseries as early
as in middle 1985, but it was only in August-September 1986
that it became widespread.
    The Institute is conducting a survey to determine how many
trees will be uprooted or base-budded. Healthy trees will be
sprayed and remain under observation.
    T.P. Lilaratne, head of the government's Rubber Controller
Department, which monitors the industry, told Reuters
replanting and base-budding would have to be undertaken before
late May when the monsoon rains begin.
    De Mel said clones in the nurseries which are susceptible
to corynespora, identified as RIC 103, RIC 52, RIC 104, RIC
106, RIC 107 and RIC 118, will be uprooted and burned.
    The same procedures will be undertaken for the foreign
clones indentified as NAB 12, RRIM 725, FX25, PPN 2444, PPN
2447, KRS 21 and PPN 2058.
    Lilaratne said the susceptible clones would be replaced by
PB 86, RRIM 600, RRIC 110, RRIC 121, RIC 100 and RIC 102.
    These six varieties would also be used to replace trees
uprooted or base-budded, De Mel said.
    Lilaratne said planters would receive 10,000 rupees per
hectare for replanting and plants would be free of charge.
    "But no compensation is contemplated at the moment," he
added.
    De Mel said a drought in Sri Lanka has helped control the
spread of the disease.
    "The drought has not stopped the disease, but probably
helped in some way because trees have not been affected in
areas that are dry," he said.
    Brokers said the disease had not affected prices because it
has not caused a drop in production.
    Prices for the best latex crepe at the Colombo auction last
week firmed to 20.19 rupees per kilo from 20.05 rupees at the

Philippine Investment Notes (PINs), to be offered to commercial
bank creditors as part of the country's 13.2 billion dlr debt
rescheduling, would revive the Baker Plan.
    PINs are tradable, foreign currency-denominated financial
instruments with a six-year maturity, designed for conversion
into pesos to fund government-approved equity investments
within the Philippines.
    Ongpin told reporters after a meeting with businessmen the
government was planning to issue between 100 and 150 mln dlrs
worth of PINs at a discount of about 12.5 pct this year.
    The plan, outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker

idea of lending additional money, Ongpin said. It had called
for substantial new commercial bank lending and development
bank aid in order to help debtor countries grow out of their

    The PINs provide a mechanism to finance the growth needed
by these debtor nations, provided they are willing to welcome
foreign equity investment into their economies, Ongpin told a
businessmen's meeting. "And this can now be achieved without
forcing commercial banks into involuntary new money lending."
    Bankers in New York said given the booming market in
debt-equity swaps, PINs ought to work if Manila issues the
notes at an appropriate discount.
    Ongpin said the use of PINs would result in anticipated
savings of one billion pesos over the debt agreement's 17-year
life.
    The accord restructured 5.8 billion dlrs of previously
rescheduled debt, 3.5 billion dlrs of debt falling due between
January 1987 and December 1992, and 925 mln dlrs of new money
lent by the banks in 1985 at a spread of 7/8 percentage points
over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).
    It also rolled over trade credits worth 2.9 billion dlrs.
    Ongpin said the Philippines' 7-1/2 year grace period was
better than Mexico's seven-year grace period, while the PINs
proposal would result in savings of foreign exchange and
generate pesos which would be reinvested in domestic
enterprises.
    Ongpin said the restructuring of commercial bank debt, as
well as of 870 mln dlrs of debt by the Paris Club of Western
creditor governments in January, was expected to reduce the
country's debt-service ratio to between 25 and 30 pct from its
current level of 40 to 45 pct.
    He said the country's balance of payments was now projected
at a surplus of about 1.2 billion dlrs in 1987, compared with a
surplus of about 1.1 billion dlrs in 1986 and a previous
projected deficit of 1.2 billion dlrs this year.
    The Philippine negotiating team refined the PINs idea three
times before the final agreement was struck last Friday, Ongpin
said. "What we have now is PINs IV," he said.
    Ongpin told the meeting he had kept his promise to gain
terms better than those granted last year to Mexico, which won
a 20-year repayment at 13/16 points over LIBOR.
    "And they (Mexico) are a long way from seeing any money
cross the table even as of today," Ongpin said, adding he
expected much quicker approval from all the Philippines' 483
creditor banks worldwide.
    He said he had been in almost daily telephone contact with
President Corazon Aquino, particularly when the banks began to
take a very tough stance on pricing.
    "But the President's instructions were unequivocal and
unwavering, 'Do not yield one more millimetre and I don't care
how long it takes. Get a green card if you have to, but don't
come home without a deal we can all be proud of'," he said.

<BODY>The Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX),
a leading trader of currency options, plans to extend its
trading hours to serve Australasian and Far Eastern markets,
exchange president Nicholas Giordano said.
    He told reporters the PHLX will open a new session between
1900 and 2300 hours U.S. EST from the beginning of the third
quarter this year.
    The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serve
clients in the region and educate financial markets about the
advantages of currency options, Giordano said.
    Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour by
exchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of the
exchange-trade currency option market against existing
over-the-counter option trading during the local working day.
    Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had become
an accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk and
had grown in popularity, he said.
    The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, including
a new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000
contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30
billion U.S. Dlrs.
    Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with the
performance of its Australian dollar contract, which since its
introduction last year had regularly topped the French franc as
the third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000
contracts traded daily.
    Having the Philadelphia exchange open during the
Asia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities,
set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading, increase
arbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuries
access to a currency option market of much greater depth and
liquidity with the security of a clearing house, he said.

<BODY>The Bank of England said the broad
measure of U.K. Money supply, Sterling M3, rose a seasonally
adjusted 2.2 pct in February after a 1.1 pct rise in January.
    The unadjusted year on year rise was 18.9 pct after 17.6
pct in the year to January, the Bank said.
    The narrow measure of money supply, M0, fell by a
seasonally adjusted 0.8 pct in February, and rose by a
non-adjusted 4.1 pct year on year. In January, M0 fell by an
adjusted 0.6 pct, and rose by a non-adjusted 4.1 pct year on
year.
    The figures confirm provisional data issued by the Bank on
March 19.
    The Bank said sterling bank lending grew by a seasonally
adjusted 2.91 billion stg in February, after a 1.70 billion stg
adjusted rise in January.
    The measure of private sector liquidity, PSL2, rose an
unadjusted 0.9 pct in February, making a year-on-year
unadjusted 13.1 pct rise. Adjusted, PSL2 rose by 1.2 pct in
February, against a 0.6 pct rise in January, the Bank said.
    It said the public sector contribution to the growth in
Sterling M3 was contractionary by about 40 mln stg after a
contractionary contribution of 2.3 billion stg in January.
    Within this, the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement showed
a repayment of 380 mln stg after a 3.7 billion stg repayment in
January, while the non-bank private sector's holdings of
government debt fell by about 260 mln stg after a 1.1 billion

    There was a 50 mln stg rise in notes and coins in
circulation in February after a 290 mln stg fall in January,
the Bank said.
    Non-interest bearing sight deposits rose by 460 mln stg
after a 1.5 billion stg fall in January and interest-bearing

<BODY>Call money rose to 3.70/80 pct from
3.50/60 pct in moderate business as liquidity drained from the
system on pension payments by insurance firms, dealers said.
    But the market was relatively liquid for the month's end,
when rates usually tighten, dealers said. Call money was still
at or slightly below the 3.80 pct rate set on the most recent
Bundesbank securities repurchase offer last week.
    The insurances would probably draw down some 11 billion
marks for pension payments. But part of this would be offset by
an estimated five to six billion marks flowing in from treasury
bills bought from the Bundesbank on Thursday, dealers said. 
    Rates could ease later in the week as bank customers
deposit part of their pension payments back with the banks
tomorrow and Wednesday, and banks face reserve requirements for
a new month, dealers said.
    On Thursday, banks' actual daily reserve holdings fell to
43.3 billion marks, down substantially from 49.1 billion on
Wednesday. But the daily average holdings for the first 25 days
of the month stood at 51.8 billion marks, well above the
required daily average net reserve holdings of 50.7 billion.    
The Bundesbank has not scheduled a securities repurchase
tender this week, since there is no expiring prior pact. 
dealers said liquidity was adequate without the addition of new
repo funding.
    If tightness does occur the Bundesbank may add short-term
temporary federal government funds to counteract this. The last
such liquidity injection was carried out as call money rates
rose above 4.00 pct earlier this month, dealers said.

following the ending in February of the 53-year old cement

that pretax profits in the year rose to 35.46 mln stg from
21.84 mln previously on turnover higher at 313.3 mln after
252.2 mln.
    The strong recovery of the first six months continued into
the second half, although U.K. Cement demand rose only
modestly. Results benefitted from cost cutting and higher
volumes.
    The decision by the Cement Makers Federation to end the
pricing agreement reflected pressure from higher competition
due to growing imports and the possibility that the system
would be taken to the Restrictive Practices Court by the U.K.

the bank's remaining 10 pct stake, a company statement said.
    In addition to these firm agreements, Mannesmann is also
talking with the state-owned steel group Salzgitter AG

 This would give Mannesmann around 75 pct of Fichtel und Sachs.
    Salzgitter said it decided to give up its own original
plans to seek a majority stake in Sachs after holding talks
with the government in Bonn.
    Earlier this month Mannesmann disclosed that it might want
a majority stake in Sachs after previously saying it was
seeking to buy only a minority holding in the company, which
has annual turnover of 2.2 billion marks and employs 17,000.
    The acquisition is part of Mannesmann's efforts to
diversify into high-technology areas and away from its previous

<BODY>The buffer stock rules agreement reached
on Friday by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) is an
improvement on previous arrangements but the price-support
mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa
prices, many ICCO delegates and trade sources said.
    The accord was reached between producers and consumers of
the 35-member ICCO council after two weeks of talks.
    European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the
accord may boost cocoa prices immediately, but world surpluses
overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long.
    "If the buffer stock operation is successful, I doubt it
will do anything more than stop the price from falling further,
and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate
prices," a European dealer said.
    And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying,
or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market
is relying on him to do so, the bearish trade reaction could
pressure prices dramatically, dealers said.
    The buffer stock is the market-regulating tool of the ICCO,
into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to
manoeuvre prices into a pre-set stabilization range.
    A new cocoa agreement came into force in January but
delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time.
    The new rules take effect immediately. The buffer stock
manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three
weeks, after organizing communications with cocoa producing
countries and assessing the market, since prices are below the
"must-buy" level of 1,600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne
specified in the agreement, the sources said.
    The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum
100,000 tonnes within a five week period, but its approach will
be more cautious, buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said.
    The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a
buying limit of 250,000 tonnes of cocoa, 100,000 tonnes of
which are already in the buffer stock.
    ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister
Denis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of
stabilizing prices. Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa
producer.
    "We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw
immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market," Bra Kanon
told reporters after the council adjourned. Bra Kanon reckoned
the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94,000
tonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee.
    However, some producer and consumer members emerged from
the final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the
pact.
    Ghana, whose high-quality cocoa is the world's most
expensive and provides 60 pct of the country's export earnings,
made a formal protest to the council about the price
differentials assigned to its cocoa, saying they were too high
for Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock.
    According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West
Germany, "Consumers weren't perfectly happy with the buffer
stock rules. We reached a very sensitive compromise...There
were no real winners or losers."
    Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that
important points were fully discussed during the talks, and as
a result, doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as
effectively as they could have, delegates said.
    Under the new rules, the buffer stock manager would seek
offers of different origin cocoas, using price differentials to
reflect different qualities. Non-ICCO member cocoa can comprise
up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock.
    London cocoa prices traded today around 1,300 stg per
tonne, down from around 1,450 stg in January 1987 and 1,750 stg
in January 1986.
    A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120,000
tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session
decides market conditions warrant it, according to the
agreement.
    The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall
below the 1,600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five
days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has
been filled, or if the buffer stock runs low on funds, it says.
    The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an
executive committee meeting on June 9/12, ICCO officials said.

<BODY>The Finance Ministry is trying to
eliminate technical obstacles so as to encourage purchases of
Japanese Treasury bills by foreign governments and central
banks, in order to increase overseas holdings of yen assets, a
senior Finance Ministry official said.
    The official declined to give details but securities
sources said they expect the 16 pct withholding tax on T-bills
to be repaid immediately when governments and central banks buy
bills. The current practice of filing tax redemption claims is
time consuming, they said.
    Securities houses here have had difficulty selling
six-month debt-financing paper, called tankoku, to overseas
governments and central banks because of the tax system and the
Bank of Japan's book entry system, which demands the accounts
be kept with the houses rather than by the Bank.
    Tankoku, introduced in February 1986, were designed as a
key short-term instrument to promote internationalization of
the yen. But since the introduction of a complicated book-entry
system for bill purchases in January 1986, foreign governments
and central banks have shied away from buying the bills, the
sources said.
    Foreign governments and central banks are therefore
expected to be allowed to hold their accounts at the Bank of
Japan, the securities sources said.
    Relevant measures are likely to be announced at the next
U.S.-Japan yen-dollar committee meeting on the deregulation of
Tokyo's financial market, expected in May, they said.

<BODY>When the largest German "universal"
banks begin announcing 1986 results this week they should
report the third consecutive record year. But prospects for
1987 and beyond would be distinctly cloudier, bank analysts
said.
    Results should show the trend which began this decade was
unbroken. The proportion of earnings gleaned from commission
business should be higher, while the role played by the more
traditional credit lending business would show further erosion.
    Stock exchange volumes remained high last year, depite only
modest share index rises in the year.
 In addition, major banks last year were very active in new
bourse flotations and primary and secondary bond market
business, banking analysts said.
    Despite last week's quite strong rally, the depressed stock
market and forecasts that it would probably not attract
sustained interest from the global investment community made a
downturn in commission business most likely.
    Pressure on the interest rate margin and the increasing
competition posed not only by foreign banks in Germany but by
foreign stock exchanges, particularly London, would also bring
more guarded prognoses for the future from board members.
    But one banking analyst said, "There's obviously no reason
to paint too dark a picture. In this decade so far, the banks
have posted practically only record profits, with increases of
50 pct and more. This cycle must clearly end sometime."
    One problem more psychological than real was West German
banks' exposure to Latin American debtor nations. Bank
officials have said that a good 70 pct of the exposure has been
written off on balance sheets.
    Some analysts consider that the conservative accounting of
German banks may in some cases have prompted the writedown of
80 or even 100 pct of several exposures there.
    With almost all Latin American exposure denominated in dlrs
and written down two or three years ago, the U.S. Currency's
fall has made further allocations to country risk reserves for
the region virtually unnecessary.
    "German bank earnings have become much more dependent on
developments on the stock exchange than on the debt question," a
second analyst said.
    It is precisely because of bank reporting rules that allow
the build up of "hidden" reserves known only to the Bundesbank,
that few analysts produced precise earnings forecasts as they
did for corporate non-banks.
    But Alastair France, of London brokers Alexanders, Laing &amp;
Cruickshank, said his clculations showed that Deutsche Bank AG
industrial empire, followed by a fairly strong drop back this
year and flat earnings in 1988.
    This contrasted with Dresdner Bank AG &lt;DRSD.F> and
Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> whose earnings would drift fractionally
lower this year and then rise modestly in 1988. On the German
DVFA basis, Deutsche should report 59 marks per share in 1986
and 49 marks in both ensuing years, France said.

<BODY>Japan is becoming dangerously isolated
again as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated by
Japanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth,
officials and businessmen from around the world said.
    As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen,
making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments
grit their teeth harder, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
there was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise.
    The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by
both sides over the key Maekawa report of April, last year.
    The document was prepared by a private committee formed by
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of
Japan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop friction
due to its large trade surpluses, Japan must "make a historical
transformation in its traditional policies on economic
management and the nation's lifestyle. There can be no further
development for Japan without this transformation."
    Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have
looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the
Japanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term
prospects of totally transforming their economic habits.
    The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese
prevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to
raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to
the U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral
semiconductor pact.
    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to
block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese
placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid
by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic
telecommunications joint venture.
    On Friday, European currency dealers said European central
banks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might
leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen.
    Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group
Keidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory
views last November when he visited the European Community.
"Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I
found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe
was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the
results of the Maekawa report," he said.
    "We explained that the process of restructuring the economy
away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between
domestic and external demand...Would take time," Saito said.
    Saito's words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial
Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said "I
only know that your government, under the leadership of
Maekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less
outward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa
report which has attracted the most attention in Europe."
    And Europeans and Americans want quick action. "A far better
answer than protectionism would be structural change within the
Japanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And
we hope to see changes occur in the near future," visiting
Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March.
    Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the
fault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea of
change in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials.
    Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business
leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade
problem.
    "We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the
Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,"
said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.
    "The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it
is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their
labour," said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of
Shearson Lehman Brothers.
    Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.
    Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as
fast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled
the country asking about this issue.
    He said People mentioned many things in line with the
spirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and
steel industries.
    A major misunderstanding is that the private report was
government policy. Europeans are confused about this,
underlined by von Moltke's reference to the "leadership" of the
Maekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last
September's government programme of new economic measures.
"Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out
that the government has put its signature to a programme
designed to implement the report," the ambassador said.

a leading trader of currency options, plans to extend its
trading hours to serve Australasian and Far Eastern markets,
exchange president Nicholas Giordano said.
    He told reporters the PHLX will open a new session between
1900 and 2300 hours U.S. EST from the beginning of the third
quarter this year.
    The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serve
clients in the region and educate financial markets about the
advantages of currency options, Giordano said.
    Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour by
exchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of the
exchange-trade currency option market against existing
over-the-counter option trading during the local working day.
    Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had become
an accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk and
had grown in popularity, he said.
    The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, including
a new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000
contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30
billion U.S. Dlrs.
    Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with the
performance of its Australian dollar contract, which since its
introduction last year had regularly topped the French franc as
the third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000
contracts traded daily.
    Having the Philadelphia exchange open during the
Asia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities,
set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading, increase
arbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuries
access to a currency option market of much greater depth and
liquidity with the security of a clearing house, he said.

    Measures for the 1,090 workers employed at the plant will
include offers of other jobs in the company, help in finding
jobs outside it and financial incentives to return home for
North African workers who make up about half of the workforce.
    "We have always said that when the Levallois plant, which

<BODY>A further rally in Dutch bonds is
likely this week, due to a lower dollar and a slightly firmer
guilder against the mark attracting investors back to guilders
from marks, bond analysts said.
    The rally began last week, as proceeds from a sell-off in
dollar paper flooded into stronger currencies.
    The state tender of a new 6.25 pct eight-year bullet
indicates a week of active trading, dealers said.
    "We've not had trade like this since last year's boom around
the May elections," said Wim Moret of Banque Paribas.
    Moret was referring to the strong demand for Dutch bonds up
to and following last year's election of Prime Minister Ruud
Lubbers, whose centre-right coalition government was pledged to
a tight economic programme which bolstered the guilder.
    Last week, a wide sell-off of dollar and sterling boosted
demand for mark and guilder paper. Japanese corporate investors
were active buyers as the end of their accounting year, March
31, approached.
    Dutch prices and trade volume reached their highest level
this year. Total turnover topped four billion guilders, after
3.5 billion in the previous active trading week.
    While volume was considerable, prices rose more moderately.
The bourse bond index rose to 117.3 last Friday, a rise of 1.9
against its level two week's earlier.
    Foreign investors took the lion's share of trade last week,
but dealers noted considerable switching by domestic investors
as the yield differential between mark and guilder issues
enticed arbitrage activity.
    The dollar, mark and sterling started this week even lower,
heightening the chances of lively foreign demand for
guilder-denominated paper, dealers said.
    Today's declines could also be partly attributed to
investors selling in a bid to force down prices ahead of the
state loan tender tomorrow.
    "This is quite a normal situation. It's natural for
investors to want the highest yield for the lowest price. It
ensures firm demand at tomorrow's tender," one dealer said.
     The terms of the new issue are seen drawing firm domestic
and foreign demand, especially since the yield premium on Dutch
long maturities has grown to 0.45 pct over similar mark issues.
    The loan will be the fourth state issue for payment this
year, and also the fourth with a 6.25 pct coupon, since Dutch
interest rates have changed little this year.
    Bond analysts said that in view of the state's practice of
weighting the bulk of its capital market borrowing in the first
half of the year, it would be likely to raise at least four
billion guilders.
    Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson, said the
state has raised about 15.3 billion of its 1987 capital market
requirement of an estimated 32 billion guilders. Of this total,
7.3 billion was raised on the public capital market.
    Basing their judgement on today's market conditions,
dealers expected the loan to be priced at 101.00 pct for a
yield of 6.09 pct.
    "But everything hinges on tomorrow. If prices decline and
yields rise, it may be priced at a fraction below that," one
dealer said.
    On the domestic front, dealers say investors are amply
covered by a 4.2 billion guilder nine-day special advance by
the Dutch central bank, which has given the money market
sufficient liquidity until Friday, when the provision expires.

<BODY>Japan is seeking to prevent its computer
chips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scale
trade war, government officials said.
    "We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won't have
an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United
States," a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
official said.
     On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300
mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo's
alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact.
    That agreement, reached last year after heated
negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips
in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.
    Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the
fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the
end of April.
    While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure
the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures
it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure
the trip's success, they said.
    "The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,"
one official told Reuters. "We would very much like to do
something to respond to that."
    In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from
spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the
U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor
makers, not to the government.
    Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an
angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been
forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor
dispute, trade analysts said.
    They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largest
chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the
draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact,
included enforced production cuts.
    The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the
announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties
the government faces in taking further action.
    "Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the
U.S./Japan agreement," said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of the
Electronic Industries Association of Japan.
    He accused the U.S. of being "irrational." He said the U.S.
action had made the bilateral chip pact "meaningless."
    Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute
through consultations.
    Japan is expected to send a high-level official to
Washington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not to
go ahead with the tariffs on April 17.
    Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industry
plans to step up purchases of U.S. chips and to propose a joint
investigation into U.S. allegations of chip dumping.

<BODY>In a bid to hasten Japan's promise
to speed up its economic growth and open markets to foreign
trade, top U.S. officials appear once again to have signaled
their tolerance of a lower dollar.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker and one of his top aides,
Assistant Secretary David Mulford, said last week there was no
target for the dollar, a statement that sent the yen soaring
against the dollar, despite massive central bank intervention.
    "That was no slip of the tongue," said one western monetary
official, who asked not to be identified.
    For now, the strategy appears to be working. Japanese
officials said late last week a package to bolster domestic
demand will be ready in early April. Until last week, there
were few indications the package would be ready anytime soon.
    The Reagan administration, facing an uproar in Congress
over the apparent lack of progress in cutting the 169.8 billion
dlr trade deficit, is learning now that to extract results from
Japan, dramatic action is required.
    Last week the White House imposed unprecedented tariffs on
certain Japanese electronic goods after Tokyo failed to adhere
to a semi-conductor pricing accord between the two countries.
    The shift in U.S. strategy, in part designed to appease
mounting Congressional anger over Japanese policies, comes just
two weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to review
the Paris agreement to stabilize currencies.
    And news that Japan earned a record 18 billion dlr trade
surplus in the first two months this year just underscored the
need for urgent action, in the view of U.S. officials.
    Nonetheless, U.S. officials see signs of improvement in the
deficit. "I'd be stunned if we were not going to derive some
benefits (from the lower dollar) soon," said one.
    In Paris, leading industrial nations agreed to cooperate
closely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting
"underlying economic fundamentals" or economic reality.
    The agreement envisages those fundamentals to include Japan
and West Germany stimulating their economies and the United
States cutting its budget deficit.
    The three nations, joined by France, Britain and Canada,
agree these policies are essential to redress huge global trade
imbalances.
    But analysts say markets have signalled the underlying
fundamentals imply a lower dollar, rather than a stable one.
    Markets, in effect, are less confident than governments
that these measures -- including U.S. budget deficit cuts
agreed by Congress and the White House --will be carried out.
    Nonetheless, the dollar's sharp fall has not undermined 
cooperation. A U.S. economic policymaker said the accord was on
track and Tokyo and Bonn seem "to want more stimulative measures
which is what the Paris accord calls for."
    International monetary sources said exchange market
developments generally have not unsettled policymakers,
although Japan is an obvious exception. "Everybody feels it can
still be managed," one source said of market developments.
    But last week, the Bank of Japan spent an estimated five
billion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen, and other
central banks about one billion dlrs.
    Another monetary source said Japan was upset with America's
half-hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar, flouting the
Paris accord outright.
    The source, close to the top levels of Japanese economic
policymaking, said Japan's understanding of the accord was that
the yen would be kept at around 154 to the dollar, the level it
stood at when the accord was struck.
    The source said Tokyo was extremely worried by Washington's
use of the exchange rate to change Japanese policies. It was a
"pointed reminder" to Japan to do something about the trade
issues, the source said of the dollar's fall against the yen.
    By departing last Sunday from the language of the Paris
accord -- that nations agreed to foster currency stability
around current levels -- Baker triggered a run on the dollar.
    Later in the week, Mulford too said there was no target for
the dollar and called on Japan and West Germany to live up to
their international responsibilities and stimulate growth.
    But U.S. officials said recent market developments will not
unravel the spirit of the Paris agreement.
    "There's a realisation now that you cannot leave things
alone, everyone agrees that the external (trade) imbalances
ought to be adjusted," one official said.
    "While no-one is going to cede national sovereignty, we
certainly seem to be moving towards much closer co-operation,"
another U.S. official said.
    The officials said the meeting here, where the six will be
joined by Italy, will be a status report.
    "Japan will have to explain what the state of their program
is and Germany will report on its plans. Maybe there's a need
to move faster," one source said.
    Mulford told Congress last week the Paris accord called, in
effect, for currency stability for several months. This would
buy time for Japan and West Germany to speed up their economic
growth and help bring down the U.S. trade deficit.
    His comments appeared to serve notice on other major
nations that Washington cannot wait too long for action to
reduce the gap between the Japanese and German trade surpluses
and the U.S. trade deficit.

<BODY>The United States and Japan will
soon settle their trade dispute over semiconductors, U.S.
Commerce secretary Malcolm Baldrige said on television.
    Baldrige, referring to the U.S.-Japan trade agreement on
semiconductors, said: "Their government wants to live up to it.
Their industries haven't been doing it, and I think we'll have
a good settlement to spare both sides."
    "I think the Japanese understand full well that they haven't
lived up to this commitment," he said.
    He added: "I do not think there will be a trade war at all."
    On Friday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300
mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods from April 17,
because of Tokyo's failure to observe the agreement.
    The officials said the tariffs would be ended as soon as
Japan started adhering to the agreement. But they said there
was little chance Japan could react quickly enough to avert the
higher tariffs.
    Baldrige said the Reagan administration hoped the strong
U.S. Action against Japan would convince Congress to tone down
protectionist trade legislation now being drafted.
    He denied the action had been taken for that reason.

<BODY>An investor partnership, seeking to
acquire GenCorp Inc, said it would attempt to unseat the
company's board of directors and take other hostile actions if
the firm refuses to discuss its 2.3 billion dlr takeover bid.
    General Acquisition Co, comprising investors Wagner and
Brown and glass-maker AFG Industries, also reiterated its
willingness to negotiate with Gencorp.
    The partnership has earlier offered 100 dlrs per share for
GenCorp -- a tire, broadcasting, plastics and aerospace
conglommerate.
    Analysts have speculated that GenCorp, on a break-up basis,
could fetch more than 110 to 120 dlrs per share.
    GenCorp officials had no comment on General Acquisition's
statement but a spokesman reiterated an earlier request to
shareholders to wait until its board renders an opinion before
making a decision on the General Acquisition tender.
    Gencorp said its statement would be made on or before the
company's annual meeting, scheduled for Tuesday.
    General Acquisition made its statement in a letter sent to
the GenCorp board on Friday.
    The partnership said it was willing to negotiate all points
of its offer, including price.
    The group the board cannot fully carry out its fiduciary
duties to GenCorp shareholders and make a fully informed
decision about its offer until it has "thoroughly explored with
us the ways in which our offer can be revised to provide
greater value to your shareholders."
    General Acquisition said it is aware the board may be
reviewing alternative transactions which might provide GenCorp
shareholders with a payment other than cash.
    "If that is the case, you should recognize that our
additional equity capital may very well enable us to offer cash
and securities having greater value than GenCorp could provide
in any similarly structured transaction," the partnership said.
    General Acquisition also said it believes that GenCorp's
board has an obligation to present any alternative transaction
it may propose to shareholders in a manner that would allow for
competing offers.
    The partnership requested that if any other proposal is
under consideration that it be given the same information
available to GenCorp's managers and advisers in constructing a
proposal.
     General Acquisition said that if GenCorp agrees to accept
another buyout proposal that it also be given an opportunity to
bid on a competitive and fair basis before any final decision
is made.
    General Acquisition repeated its request that GenCorp
remove its "poison pill" or shareholders rights plan.
    General Acquisition said if GenCorp does not allow an
"environment for fair competition," it will take all steps
necessary to create such an enviroment.
    It said it may take legal action or seek the support of
shareholders in calling a special meeting to replace the board
and to consider other proposals it might develop.
    General Acquisition also said if the board decides to
accept an alternate proposal it asked that it not accept a plan
that would include defensive features.

<BODY>Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has
withdrawn a request to Washington to suspend operations at an
American army base near Athens as a Greek-Turkish row over oil
rights in the Aegean eased.
    A Turkish research ship which Greece had threatened to
tackle if it sailed into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea kept
to Turkish territorial waters yesterday, avoiding a potential
clash.
    Papandreou expressed qualified optimism after briefing
opposition leaders on Aegean developments early yesterday.
    The Greek government later withdrew Friday's request to
Washington to close down its telecommunications base at Nea
Makri, north of Athens, saying that the reasons which had
prompted it to make the request were no longer valid.
    Under the terms of the U.S.-Greek bases accord, Greece has
the right to ask for suspension of operations at times when its
national interests are threatened.
    The row in the Aegean erupted after Turkey said it would
search for oil round three Greek islands off its coast
following an announcement from Greece that it planned to drill
east of Thassos island after taking control of a Canadian-led
oil consortium operating in the northern Aegean.
    Turkey accused Greece of breaching the 1976 Berne Agreement
under which both sides agreed to preserve the status quo in the
Aegean until their continental shelf dispute was settled.
Athens says it considers the accord inactive.
    The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it had
received an assurance from Greece that it would not carry out
oil activities outside its territorial waters. Greece declined
comment on the statement.
    Papandreou repeated an invitation to Turkey to take the
long-standing continental shelf dispute to the International
Court of Justice at The Hague.
    Conservative opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis said
he had urged Papandreou to accept an offer from NATO General
Secretary Lord Carrington to help resolve the row.

Philippine Investment Notes (PINs), to be offered to commercial
bank creditors as part of the country's 13.2 billion dlr debt
rescheduling, would revive the Baker Plan.
    PINs are tradable, foreign currency-denominated financial
instruments with a six-year maturity, designed for conversion
into pesos to fund government-approved equity investments
within the Philippines.
    Ongpin told reporters after a meeting with businessmen the
government was planning to issue between 100 and 150 mln dlrs
worth of PINs at a discount of about 12.5 pct this year.
    The plan, outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker

idea of lending additional money, Ongpin said. It had called
for substantial new commercial bank lending and development
bank aid in order to help debtor countries grow out of their
economic troubles.
    The PINs provide a mechanism to finance the growth needed
by these debtor nations, provided they are willing to welcome
foreign equity investment into their economies, Ongpin told a
businessmen's meeting. "And this can now be achieved without
forcing commercial banks into involuntary new money lending."
    Bankers in New York said given the booming market in
debt-equity swaps, PINs ought to work if Manila issues the
notes at an appropriate discount.
    Ongpin said the use of PINs would result in anticipated
savings of one billion pesos over the debt agreement's 17-year
life.
    The accord restructured 5.8 billion dlrs of previously
rescheduled debt, 3.5 billion dlrs of debt falling due between
January 1987 and December 1992, and 925 mln dlrs of new money
lent by the banks in 1985 at a spread of 7/8 percentage points
over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).
    It also rolled over trade credits worth 2.9 billion dlrs.
    Ongpin said the Philippines' 7-1/2 year grace period was
better than Mexico's seven-year grace period, while the PINs
proposal would result in savings of foreign exchange and
generate pesos which would be reinvested in domestic
enterprises.
    Ongpin said the restructuring of commercial bank debt, as
well as of 870 mln dlrs of debt by the Paris Club of Western
creditor governments in January, was expected to reduce the
country's debt-service ratio to between 25 and 30 pct from its
current level of 40 to 45 pct.
    He said the country's balance of payments was now projected
at a surplus of about 1.2 billion dlrs in 1987, compared with a
surplus of about 1.1 billion dlrs in 1986 and a previous
projected deficit of 1.2 billion dlrs this year.
    The Philippine negotiating team refined the PINs idea three
times before the final agreement was struck last Friday, Ongpin
said. "What we have now is PINs IV," he said.
    Ongpin told the meeting he had kept his promise to gain
terms better than those granted last year to Mexico, which won
a 20-year repayment at 13/16 points over LIBOR.
    "And they (Mexico) are a long way from seeing any money
cross the table even as of today," Ongpin said, adding he
expected much quicker approval from all the Philippines' 483
creditor banks worldwide.
    He said he had been in almost daily telephone contact with
President Corazon Aquino, particularly when the banks began to
take a very tough stance on pricing.
    "But the President's instructions were unequivocal and
unwavering, 'Do not yield one more millimetre and I don't care
how long it takes. Get a green card if you have to, but don't
come home without a deal we can all be proud of'," he said.

<BODY>European Community agriculture
ministers are today taking their first serious look at farm
price proposals for the coming season, but diplomats expect no
agreement at the two days of talks.
    Experts say the proposals put forward last month by the
European Commission could lead to a double-digit percentage
fall in guaranteed prices for the 1987/88 crop year.
    Consideration of the price measures comes as farm surpluses
and subsidies are set to dominate forthcoming talks under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT.
    The talks signal the official start of months of annual
wrangling over subsidy levels paid to the EC's 12 mln farmers.
    Agriculture worldwide is plagued by surplus production and
depressed prices, with domestic economic policies largely
blamed for the crisis. The U.S. Has signaled it wants the issue
of world over-supply pushed to the top of the list of
international economic issues to be negotiated this year.
    EC diplomats say that to a large extent this view is shared
in Europe, but the political strength of well-organised farm
lobbies leaves ministers with little room for manoeuvre.

<BODY>The government is determined to ride out
the latest sharp rise of the yen without taking panic measures
because it expects the currency's appreciation to prove
temporary, senior officials said.
    "The market has already located a ceiling (for the yen) and
market forces are pushing the dollar back up a bit," one senior
Finance Ministry official said.
    He attributed the dollar's fall in recent days to special
factors, in particular, selling by Japanese investors ahead of
the March 31 end to their fiscal year.
    That selling largely came to an end this morning after
about one hour of trading here, the senior official said. "They
(the investors) became more or less quiet after 10 o'clock
(0100 GMT)," he said.
    After falling to a record low of 144.70 yen this morning,
the dollar edged back up in late trading to end at 146.20.
Dealers attributed the late rise to remarks by Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone that major nations had agreed to stabilise
the dollar above 150 yen.
    Several officials said they did not see any fundamental
reason for the dollar's recent sharp fall.
    One official even called the market's recent actions
irrational. If anything, the U.S. Decision to slap tariffs on
Japanese electronics goods should support the dollar against
the yen because it will cut Japanese exports to the U.S., He
said.
    As a result, several officials said they saw no reason to
alter the broad thrust of government policy agreed to at last
month's meeting of major nations in Paris.
    "We don't see any substantial reason to change our policy
stance," one senior official said.

Yasuhiro Nakasone that last month's G-6 meeting agreed to

influence currency trading, dealers said.

from an initial low of 144.20/40 and New York's Friday finish
of 147.15/25. But the rebound was largely on short-covering,
they said.
    "I think (Nakasone's) desperate," said a U.S. Bank foreign

that Japan and other industrialized nations committed
themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above

    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee
that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And
West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar
fell below 150 yen.

is likely to rebound. But he warned of another dip to below 145

<BODY>The dollar's tumble to a record low of
144.70 yen in Tokyo today motivated some major Japanese
investors to lighten their U.S. Bond inventory further and is
expected to spur diversification into investment assets
including foreign and domestic shares, dealers said.
    The key U.S. 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond due 2016 fell to a low
of 96.08-12 in early Tokyo trade against the 98.05-06 New York
finish, then recovered to 96.20-22.
    Some trust bank pension fund acccounts and investment
trusts were seen selling several hundred million dollars on the
foreign exchange market here today, accentuating the unit's
tumble, securities house dealers said.
    They seem undecided on what to do with the fresh yen cash
positions resulting from their dollar sales today, and are
sidelined until the currency market stabilises and the interest
rates outlook clarifies, a Nikko Securities Co Ltd currency
trader said.
    The dollar's plunge and low yields on U.S. Bonds will
further promote diversification into other foreign investments,
as well as call back funds into the domestic bond and stock
markets from overseas bond markets, securities bond managers
said.
    They said major Japanese investors in the past two years
are estimated to have held 50 to 80 pct of their foreign
portfolios in U.S. Bonds but many have lightened their U.S.
Bond inventory to as low as 40 pct.
    Since late last year, Japanese investors, seeking
substantial liquidity and attractive yields, have used fresh
funds to buy mark and Canadian dollar bonds and, after the
Paris currency pact, actively bought French franc bonds and
gilts while gradually lightening U.S. Bond inventories, the
managers said.
    Dealers said funds tied up in foreign assets had flowed
into local bond and stock markets as well.
    The yield of the key 5.1 pct 89th bond dropped to a record
low of 4.080 pct today from the 4.140 Saturday finish and
compared with 4.25 pct on three-month certificates of deposit.
    The key bond has fluctuated less than five basis points for
more than a month here, suggesting most dealers could not
satisfy their needs for capital gains, dealers said.
    A market survey by Reuters showed some active accounts in
U.S. Treasuries are currently dealing on Tokyo's stock market.
The stock market's bullishness late last week was partly due to
funds transferred from U.S. Treasuries, dealers said.
    Japanese net purchases of foreign securities in the first
half of March fell an estimated one billion dlrs compared with
average monthly net purchases of 7.7 billion for the whole of
1986, Finance Ministry sources said.
    The steep fall is due to Japanese investors' cool attitude
towards U.S. Bonds, which had amounted to more than 80 pct of
total foreign securities purchased, securities houses managers
said.
    Foreign stock buying in March is expected to exceed the
record high of 1.5 billion dlrs seen in December, they said.
    "Diversification of foreign portfolios is underway and we
have bought bonds in currencies such as marks, the Canadian
dollar, the ECU and French franc," a fund manager at &lt;Yasuda

manufacturing and construction.
    Within manufacturing, strong gains were posted in the wood,
machinery, non-metallic mineral and food product groups.
Significant declines were recorded in the output of automobiles
and parts, however.
    In the services sector, increases in finance, insurance and

    The four computers expected to be announced April 2 will
reportedly include one low end, low cost computer, two models
that will resemble IBM's current high-end AT, and, most
importantly, a computer incorporating Intel Corp's &lt;INTC> 80386
microprocessor, the powerhouse chip that is revolutionizing the
personal computer.
    The microprocessor is the brains of a computer and Intel
microprocessors are the ones used in all IBM and IBM-compatible
personal computers, by far the largest segment of the desktop
market.
     The 80386, more commonly called the 386, processes
computer instructions twice as fast as the chips used in
existing IBM computers and 386-based desktop computers are as
powerful as the much larger minicomputers of a few years ago.
     Although IBM will not be the first company to introduce a
386 personal computer - Compaq Corp &lt;CPQ> was - most industry
consultants believe that customers will not rush to embrace the
new generation until they see what the world's largest computer
company is going to do.
    What IBM will apparently do is introduce a computer that
is, at least temporarily, copy-proof. That is a far different
situation than exists with IBM's current family of personal
computers, which are cloned widely.
     With the Personal System, IBM will reportedly build as
many features as possible directly into the computers'
motherboards, including graphics capabilities, a non-standard
bus for add-on equipment and a new version of the operating
system used on all IBM compatible computers.
     The word in (Silicon) Valley is that it will take two mln
dlrs and 18 months before the machines can be copied,'' said
Michael Murphy, publisher of the newsletter California
Technology Stock Letter.
      At the same time as Personal System is unveiled,
Microsoft Corp &lt;MSFT> is expected to unveil a new version of
its MS/DOS operating system, DOS 3.3, that will correct many of
the programming problems encountered on earlier versions of the
software. MS/DOS is used with all IBM personal computers.
      Consultants said that most existing IBM-compatible
software will run on the new computers but software written
specifically for the Personal System will not run on older
models.
     The industry will be looking closely at the delivery dates
for the new computers, particularly the 386, because if IBM
does not start shipping its entry in this important new market
soon, Compaq will continue to gain larger and larger market
share.
    Market researcher Future Computing Inc estimated that
Compaq's Deskpro 386, which started shipping last October, is
generating sales of between 3.5 mln and and four mln dlrs a
month. In the first six months of availability between 21 and
24 mln dlrs worth of Deskpro 386s were sold.
    Said Future Computing analyst Joe Cross, "That's some
indication of the kind of money IBM is leaving on the table."

<BODY>Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countries
for emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by the
country's worst drought in 36 years, government officials said.
    Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aid
needed for a sixth of Sri Lanka's population in 13 districts.
    The letter said the government had to step in "to avert
serious economic hardship" and because the Social Services
Ministry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provision
of 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas.
    The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a six
month period, at least until the May-September (Yala) rice crop
was harvested. Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat, rice, flour and
other cereals were required, it said, along with supplies of
sugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk.
    In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha
(October 1986-April 1987) crop had been "almost completely
devastated," the letter said. Maha paddy output was now
estimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originally
expected.
    There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a high
forecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate
rainfall within the next three to four weeks.
    "Should the present drought continue, however, production is
estimated at around 20 mln bushels," the letter added.
    Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90
and 110 mln bushels, or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Last
year's output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985.
    The letter said villagers in most seriously affected
districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because
subsidiary crops had also failed.
    It said the government's current budget did not permit it
to provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected.
"Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity
prices and slowing of the economy. Defence commitments continue
to exert pressure on the expenditure side."
    The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees per
month for each family, as well as handling, transport and
distribution of emergency food. But such an outlay of funds by
the government would not be possible without seriously
impairing development projects, or "greatly fuelling inflation"
in the economy, the letter said.
    The letter said the Food Department would be able to
release wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet the
immediate cereal requirements "provided such stocks are replaced
subsequently."
    The Meteorological Department said the country was
experiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-month
dry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break when
the monsoon rains fell in late May.
    The letter said some areas had been experiencing the
drought since August, and in the rice growing district of
Kurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June
1986.

<BODY>The International Primary Market Makers
Association, a trade organisation, said its board last week
adopted new rules recommending lead managers of eurodollar bond
issues make a market in that security for 12 months.
    Currently, while there is an implied obligation on the part
of firms to make markets in issues they underwrite, there is no
formal obligation to do so.
    Christopher Sibson, secretary general of IPMA, in
explaining why the recommendation was adopted, said "It is aimed
at the problem of the lead manager who does a deal and
disappears."
    Sibson said the organization cannot force its members to
adhere to the rule. "We're under no illusions about the legal
binding force of these recommendations," he said.
    Lead managers have occasionally abandoned efforts to
support an unprofitable issue just a short while after it has
been offered, leaving investors and smaller firms with no one
to buy it back from them.
    Most recently, when prices of perpetual floating rates
notes (FRNs) suddenly plunged, most market makers abandoned the
securities altogether, leaving investors stuck with about 17
billion dlrs worth of unmarketable securities on their books.
     Sibson noted that the recommendation adopted by the board
only applies  to fixed-rate dollar issues and would not have
helped the floating rate sector out of its current crisis.
    Among other measures, the IPMA also decided that the
criteria for membership should be tightened to exclude some of
the smaller firms.
    Under the new rules, a firm must be the book running lead
manager during the two preceding years of 12 internationally
distributed debt issues denominated in U.S. Dlrs or in one of
eight other major currencies.
    The former requirement called for three lead-managed
issues. Sibson said he expects the tighter entrance
requirements to pare 3he current list of 67 members down by six
to 10 members.
    Smaller firms have criticized IPMA's efforts to restrict
membership to the larger firms, saying it is anti-competitive
and that it reinforces the big firms' already large market
share.
    "Belonging to IPMA carries a certain amount of prestige with
borrowers," said a dealer at a small foreign bank. "The borrower
says to himself, "Well I can travel economy or I can travel
first class,'" he said.
    Sibson defended the new rules saying "We have to steer a
course between representing the interests of the major market
makers and the less desirable goal of representing everybody."
    In any event, he said, the size of the market has expanded
to the point where the former minimum size requirements were
just too small.
    Also, IPMA members will be required to register with the
Association of International Bond Dealers as reporting dealers,
submitting daily information on prices on issues in which they
are market makers. The effective date of the rule has yet to be
determined.
    Dealers said that the rule would enable investors and
secondary market makers to better evaluate the appropriate
market price for their securities. Such a rule would make
investors more confident of trading in the eurobond market and
would increase liquidity, they said.
    Dealers said that the form of the reporting has not yet
been spelled out. But previous discussion of the reporting
requirement considered firms listing the closing price of a
given security as well as the high and low for the day.
     Members also agreed at the IPMA meeting on the
implementation of a new communications system which enables a
lead manager to invite all potential management group members
in to a deal at the same time.

few buyers appeared to take up the slack. Much of the momentum
was derived from the futures market, where a high 33,074 lots
were traded in the long gilt June contract.
    The Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08 closed 1-7/16
point lower at 135-20/32 stg pct while the Treasury 10 pct due
1991 ended at 105-12/32 for a fall of 1-3/16.
    Dealers noted that market confidence had already been at a
low ebb, with much of the recent impressive rise whittled away
last week as investors reacted nervously to opinion polls
showing unexpectedly strong gains for the centrist
Liberal/Social Democratic alliance.
    The market had been sustained in large part during its
recent rally by a virtual conviction that the ruling
Conservative party would first call and then win a general
election early this summer.
    However, advances credited to the alliance last week have
cast doubt on both assumptions.
    "Turnover in the cash market has actually been quite small,"
one dealer said, adding that price movements had been very
volatile at times.
    After losing ground heavily in the Far East in tandem with
the flagging dollar, U.S. Bonds fell further in London trading
but showed some signs of recovery late in the U.S. Morning as
the dollar steadied a little against the yen. The latest period
of weakness for the dollar has accentuated fears that currency
risk might induce Japanese investors in particular to undertake
dramatic reductions in their portfolios of U.S. Treasury
issues.
    Dealers noted that early strength in the index-linked
sector of the market, which had enabled the Government broker
to supply some of both index-linked stock tranches announced on
Friday, had soon fallen prey to the general depression
affecting gilts.
    The Treasury 2-1/2 pct index-linked stock due 2020 closed
just under one point lower at 100-11/32 stg pct.

it has filed a suit against Reynolds and Reynolds Co &lt;REYNA>,
charging the company with pirating a computer-based voice
messaging system for auto dealer service departments (CASI),
using confidential information it received while test marketing
the system for Advanced Voice.
    Advanced Voice said the suit also charges that Reynolds and
Reynolds advised present and potential customers of Advanced
Voice not to use or buy its CASI system in an attempt to drive
the Nashville, Tenn.-based company out of interstate sales to
auto dealerships.
    The lawsuit, filed in a Detroit U.S. District Court, seeks
preliminary and permanent injunctions to stop Reynolds and
Reynolds from using or disclosing information it gained from
Advanced Voice, as well as punitive and compensatory damages,
Advnaced Voice said.
    The company also said in its suit it had signed a
confidentiality agreement with Reynolds and Reynolds before
giving it business and technical information about the CASI
system. Afterwards, Reynolds and Reynolds told Advanced Voice
it would not distribute the CASI system, but would develop its
own instead, Advanced Voice said.
    "We held virtually nothing back from Reynolds and Reynolds

<BODY>Chances that the International Coffee
Organization, ICO, executive board meeting this week will agree
to resume negotiations on export quotas soon look remote, ICO
delegates and trade sources said.
    ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries are
ready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side that
reopening negotiations again would be worthwhile, they said.
    ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight days
when producers and consumers failed to reach agreement.
     "Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions,
it's difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage,"
Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said. But quotas must be
negotiated sometime, he said.
     The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotas
but that Brazil must be flexible, rather than refuse to lower
its export share as it did in the last negotiations, delegates
said.
     At this week's March 31-April 2 meeting, the 16-member ICO
board is scheduled to discuss the current market situation, the
reintroduction of quotas, verification of stocks and some
administrative matters, according to a draft agenda.
    The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio
Dauster, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum and
chief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending the
meeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be a
non-event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned.
    "I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking among
producers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposal
by September (the next scheduled council meeting)," Bronwyn

    Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that a
date will be set for an earlier council meeting.
    If the stalemate continues much longer, analysts expect the
coffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for the
remainder of its life, to September 30, 1989.
    When talks broke down, the U.S. and Brazil, the largest
coffee consumer and producer respectively, blamed one another
for sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise.
    Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares,
under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports,
but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for shares
to be redistributed using "objective criteria," which would have
threatened Brazil's share.
    At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers,
Costa Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put their
objections as members of the group of eight ICO "dissident"
producers aside, in order to stem the damaging decline in
prices, Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez
Cuenca told reporters Saturday. He was in London to brief
producers on the Managua meeting.
    However, other producers said they were not aware of this
move toward producer solidarity.
    London coffee prices closed at 1,276 stg a tonne today,
down from around 1,550 at the beginning of March.

<BODY>The U.S. Congress is making Japan,
with its enormous worldwide trade surplus, the symbol of the
U.S. trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn around
America's record trade deficit.
    "Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade: the
challenge to our high technology industries, the threat of
government nutured competition, and the multitude of barriers
to our exports," Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said.
    "If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over trade
problems, we can manage our difficulties with other countries,"
the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committee
hearing on the trade bill.
    Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, have
made trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-ranging
bill is being readied for probable House approval next month.
    Japan's bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrs
in 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year. Its surplus rose to 8.14
billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January.
    Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade
deficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to
the dollar's decline in world currency markets as a reason to
press Japan to buy more U.S. goods.
    They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration
in U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology.
    In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S.
semiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced he
intended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese
electronic goods in retaliation for Japan's failure to abide by
a 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement.
    Congress also has been been angered by the administration's
lack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues
including beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunications
goods, and financial services.
    The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in
four committees. It is a package of trade sanctions and
measures to force the administration take tough action against
foreign trade barriers and unfair competition.
    Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in many
cases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese
products or make them more expensive with higher duties.
    The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House
Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is to
force President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign
competition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to win
temporary relief from surges in imports.
    The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrict
imports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not
buy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House.
    Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirant
from Missouri, has the support of Wright and other key
Democrats to press for passage of the amendment.
    The measure would have the most impact on Japan, West
Germany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, does
not reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States would
set import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten per
cent a year for three years.
    "I'm tired of going into companies and having managers say
to me, 'We're not over competing in Japan because we can't
compete in the marketplace.' That argument needs to be taken
away from American business," Gephardt said.
    The administration has said it could not support a trade
bill containing such a provision.

<BODY>The U.S. Senate has approved a
measure that would allow an estimated 4,200 agricultural banks
to write off loan losses over 10 years.
    The measure, offered by Sen. Alan Dixon (D-Ill.), was
attached to a bill to recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp that the Senate approved March 27.
    Dixon's amendment would permit agricultural banks -- banks
with assets of 100 mln dlrs or less and at least 25 pct of
total loans in farm loans -- to write down over 10 years
agricultural loan losses incurred between 1984 and 1992.
    Dixon said current law, which requires losses to be
deducted immediately from bank capital, "forces banks to try not
to acknowledge the extent of their problems."
    Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) said farm banks have been
concerned that write-downs might reduce their capitalization
below the six pct regulatory requirement.
    Last year Congress urged federal regulators to use
forbearance in the assessment of agricultural loans. However,
Kassebaum said "only a miniscule number of banks" have qualified
for the capital forbearance provisions.
    Dixon's measure also would allow agricultural banks to
amortize losses on the reduced value of farmland acquired in
the handling of agricultural loans.

<BODY>Prime Minister Jacques Chirac said the
budget deficit next year will be reduced by about 15 billion
francs, and the government's planned programme of 50 billion
francs' tax cuts for 1987/88 will be implemented, a statement
from the Prime Minister's office said.
    The forecasts were contained in a letter of guidance to
ministries to prepare for the 1988 budget to be voted by
Parliament in autumn.
    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur plans to cut the 1988
budget deficit to around 115 billion francs from the forecast
1987 deficit of 129 billion, and to 100 billion francs in 1989.
    Chirac's statement said that to achieve the twin aims of
reducing the deficit and granting tax relief "a vigourous effort
to contain spending will have to be made."
    As in his letter to ministries last year, Chirac repeated
the aim to reduce by 1.5 pct the number of civil servants
except those in teaching or the security services.
    Budgetary adjustments made by the various government
ministries will collated by Balladur in mid-July, who will then
present them to the Prime Minister.

<BODY>General Motors Corp has cut 100,000
cars from its second quarter production schedule, according to
Automotive News.
    The trade paper, citing "sources both within GM and on the
outside," said GM plans to build 1,042,708 cars in the quarter,
a nine pct reduction from its earlier estimate. The cut could
lead to further layoffs at GM, it said.
    A GM spokesman said the company does not disclose future 
production schedules.
    Auto analysts said the cut would make sense for GM, which
has high car inventories.
    A 100,000-car reduction in output would only take GM part
of the way toward reducing high inventories, said Ron Glantz,
analyst with Montgomery Securities.
    "They should be cutting a lot more than they are," Shearson
Lehman analyst Michael Lucky said. He estimated that, even if
GM cut an additional 100,000 cars from its second quarter
production, it would still have a 75-day supply of cars.
    Normal inventory level is 50 to 65 days supply. At the end
of March, the automaker had 95 days supply, Lucky said.
    Glantz said that at the end of February GM had 361,000
excess vehicles, including both cars and trucks.
    The production cuts could lead to increased layoffs,
although those would likely be temporary rather than indefinite
layoffs, said Lucky.
    He said the automaker might also use this as an opportunity
to close some plants. Lucky estimates that GM needs to shut two
or three more assembly plants to bring its capacity more in
line with demand.

<BODY>Nigeria plans to issue on April 7 a
further 1.5 billion dlrs in short-term promissory notes to its
uninsured trade creditors in connection with existing arrears
on those debts, Law Debenture Trust Corp Plc said as trustee
for the notes.
    It said Nigeria also plans to hold talks with a newly
appointed representative for those creditors fairly soon, and
that Nigeria also will call "at an early date" an extraordinary
meeting of noteholders, including holders of the new notes. The
purpose of that meeting will be to consider a resolution to the
arrears on the trade debt and the promissory notes.
    Nigeria missed the first principal payment due on the notes
last autumn and another payment of about 30 mln dlrs that was
due in early January because of a cash shortage, which stemmed
partly from the drop in oil prices last year.
    An official of the Law Debenture Trust said he did not know
when the new representative for the noteholders, David Murison,
would meet the Nigerians. He noted the Nigerians currently are
attempting to negotiate bilateral agreements with members of
the Paris Club of western creditor governments under a
multilateral pact on these debts reached in December. So far,
bilateral accords have been reached with the U.K. And France.
    Law Debenture Trust, as trustee for the notes, has been
attempting to organise a meeting between the note holders and
Nigeria for the last coupole of months. The appointment of
Murison, chairman of Westpac Banking Corp's Mase Westpac Ltd
unit in London, was made in an effort to better coordinate
these efforts.
    The Law Debenture official said Murison will begin talks
with Nigeria as soon as they return to London. And although it
is hoped that a meeting of all note holders could be held by
end-May, he said this may not be possible since four weeks
notice of the meeting is required by law.
    The discussions with the note holders are being held in
conjunction with proposals to rescheduling Nigeria's debt to
commercial banks and official credit agencies.
    When talks began last April on rescheduling part of the
country's approximate 19 billion dlrs of foreign debt, the
commercial banks insisted that it be contingent on Nigeria
obtaining a rescheduling of its official debts as well. The
Nigerians then extended this to include all uninsured trade
debt.
    The commercial bank package has yet to be signed due in
part to the reluctance of Japanese banks, which have a
relatively small exposure, to participate.

number of investors right now for the paper," he said.
    On Thursday, Bear, Stearns and Co sole-managed a 100 mln
New Zealand dlr offering of three-year floating-rate notes
issued by Ford Motor Credit Co, a unit of Ford Motor Co &lt;F>.
    The initial rate for the notes will be set on April 15, and
quarterly after that, at 200 basis points below the 90-day New
Zealand bank bill rate. They are non-callable for life.
    This followed by a week another Bear Stearns-led offering
of the same amount of New Zealand dollar notes for Dow Chemical
Co &lt;DOW>. The initial rate was also to be initially set on
April 15, and quarterly after that, at 340 basis points below
the same 90-day New Zealand rate.
    Because the Dow Chemical notes carried an interest rate
floor of 17 pct, the issue saw strong investor demand,
underwriters said.
    But the Ford Credit notes and Friday's offering of 130 mln
New Zealand dlrs of floating-rate notes due 1990 issued by
General Electric Co's &lt;GE> General Electric Credit Corp via
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc, did not have such a floor.
    "Obviously, the two firms did not want to issue floaters
and face the risk of New Zealand rates falling sharply," an
underwriter away from the syndicates said. He and others noted
that the New Zealand 90-day rate was 27 pct late last week.
    An underwriter familiar with the Dow Chemical deal pointed
out that because of the interest rate and currency swaps Dow
did, the issuer felt comfortable setting a rate floor.
    Domestic offerings of foreign currency denominated date
first surfaced in Fall 1985. By using currency and rate swaps,
companies can sell debt that pays a high interest rate in a
foreign currency like Australian or New Zealand dollars. But
the issuers actually realize savings on borrowing costs.
    "I would say that every company which issued foreign
currency debt saved some basis points when compared to
same-maturity plain vanilla U.S. issues," an analyst said.
    Investors, mainly institutions, were attracted to the early
issues because of the high interest rates. They were willing to
absorb foreign currency risk until mid-1986, when sharp slides
posted by the Australian and New Zealand dollars brought such
issuance to a quick halt.
    It was not until late last year, after the currencies
stabilized, that companies again started issuing debt
denominated in Australian and New Zealand dollars.
    But many investors have still shied away from the debt,
remembering the mid-1986 downturn of the Australian and New
Zealand dollars, analysts noted.
    To attract some of those investors back to the fold,
underwriters like Bear Stearns decided to structure the foreign
currency issues as floating rate debt, sources said.
    This occurred against a backdrop of uncertainty over the
course of U.S. interest rates for the intermediate term, and
predictions by a number of economists that Treasury yields
would rise in the second half of the year, the sources noted.
    A Bear Stearns officer said more than half of the Ford
Credit notes were sold by late Friday afternoon, the second day
of offering. "That is quicker than some recent fixed-rate New
Zealand dollar note issues," he said.
    However, underwriters away from the Bear Stearns syndicate
said the issue may have sold even faster if Prudential-Bache
did not offer the General Electric Credit notes on Friday.
    They pointed out that the Ford notes were rated A-1 by
Moody's Investors and AA-minus by Standard and Poor's, while
the General Electric notes, which had the same interest rate
terms and were also non-callable to maturity, carried
top-flight AAA ratings by both agencies.
    "We have sold 20 to 25 pct of the GE notes. For first-day
sales on a Friday afternoon, I'm happy with the results," an
officer on Prudential-Bache's syndicate desk said.
    Investors pay the U.S. dollar equivalent of the foreign
currency-denominated notes, underwriters said.
    Investment bankers said the next floating-rate issue of New
Zealand or Australian dollar-denominated debt is probably a few
weeks away.
    "I would like to underwrite a deal a day. But with the Dow,
Ford and GE offerings, the marketplace has had enough for the
time being," the Prudential-Bache officer admitted.
    Meanwhile, IDD Information Services said the 30-day
corporate visible supply fell to 3.29 billion dlrs last week
from 3.98 billion dlrs in the previous week.

    A company spokesman declined comment.
    The company was hit by the decline in Saudi Arabia's

with Saudi bank creditors by ceding them a hospital, shares and
an office building, bankers said.
    The four non-Saudi banks, however, decided to press their
claims in the court.
    The bankers and lawyers said claims are based on promissory
notes signed by the limited liability company and backed by
personal guarantees signed by Abdulla Fouad, his two wives and
his sons and daughters.
    The claims are for a 34.2 mln riyal loan from ABC, a 42 mln
riyal syndicated loan led by Bank of America and including BBK
and two loans of 15 mln riyals and 40 mln signed from Citibank.
    The loans were signed between july 1984 and january 1985.

<BODY>The Governor of the Central Bank of
West African CFA franc zone countries (UMOA) today urged that
the bank should be involved in all negotiations with the
International Monetary Fund but said the zone's seven member
countries were not thinking of ditching the fund.
    Abdoulaye Fadiga told reporters after a regular one-day
meeting of UMOA finance ministers here that the bank's
participation in future credit talks with the IMF would promote
a greater coherence in Fund aid granted to the region.
    But he stresed that UMOA, which last month called for a new
relationship with the IMF, was not contemplating a break with
the fund.
    "Member states (of UMOA) never envisaged breaking with the
Fund," he said.
    Fadiga said an extraordinary UMOA meeting held in Ivory
Coast's inland capital, Yamoussoukro, last month, stresssed the
need for growth-oriented IMF adjustment policies.
    "Borrowing to pay off debts cannot be a solution," he added.
    UMOA members are Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali,
Niger, Senegal and Togo. The zone's common-curreny, the CFA
franc, is pegged to the French franc at the rate of 50 CFA
francs to one French franc.
    Fadiga said many of the region's problems stem from low
commodity prices and a weak dollar.
    He applauded last week's agreement between producers and
consumers on the functioning of a new international cocoa pact,
saying negotiation of other commodity accords would benefit
UMOA countries.
    He also urged action to persuade West Africans to transfer
more money through the regular banking system rather than using
non-official channels.

a 0.9 pct increase from the previous Friday and Urals were up
22 cts a barrel to 19.16 dlrs, a 1.2 pct increase.

generally lower with Brent valued at 18.89 dlrs, off 30 cts
from the previous friday, and Bonny Light was off 17 cts to
19.58 dlrs a barrel.
    Refinery netbacks in Singapore were also lower, with
heavier and sour crudes weakest. Arab Heavy dropped 10 cts to
16.63 dlrs a barrel and Dubai was off 12 cts to 18.09 dlrs.
    On the U.S. West Coast, however, netback values for ANS CIF

<BODY>The Brazilian Coffee Institute,
IBC, is expected to maintain its previous pricing system when
it reopens export registrations, probably later this week,
exporters said.
    They said IBC President Jorio Dauster is likely to leave
the basic formula for the minimum registration price unchanged
but raise the contribution quota to partially offset the
effects of cruzado devaluation since April registrations were
closed in mid-February.
    To fully compensate for devaluation the quota would have to
be around 28 dlrs per bag against 7.0 when registrations closed.
    However, even a 21 dlr per bag rise in the contribution
quota would make Brazil coffees uncompetitive on world markets,
and an increase to around 15 dlrs a bag is more likely, the
exporters said.
    They added that Dauster is keen to raise the contribution
quota as the Institute needs money to repay Central Governmnet
funds released to finance IBC purchases at the guaranteed
producer price.
    Although a vote in the Monetary Council to provide more
funds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds last
week, funds are still being released for subsequent approval.
    The sources said it is still unclear when registrations
will be reopened, although most expect it to be by the end of
this week.
    "Brazil owes it to its customers to make its intentions
know. A country like Brazil cannot afford to be permanently
closed down," one exporter said.
    However, before announcing its export policy the IBC is
likely to wait to see if tomorrow's meeting of the
International Coffee Organisation, ICO, executive board in
London decides to call a full council meeting to discuss
reintroduction of export quotas, sources said.
    There is also talk of the announcement this week of new
measures to adjust the Brazilian economy, and the IBC could be
awaiting clarification before making any move, the exporters
said.
    Another factor which could be delaying the opening of
registrations is the current strike by bank workers which,
while not affecting current shipments, could affect
documentation and currency operations for new sales.
    This would certainly be the case if the IBC was considering
obliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two or
three days of registering a sale.

<BODY>Ashland Oil Inc is actively seeking a
chemical acquisition and is willing to spend between 100 to 200
mln dlrs, Chairman John Hall said.
    "We're looking for privately held companies or units of
other companies. We think it's too dificult to go (shopping) on
the stock market where premiums are so high," Hall told
Reuters. He was in Houston to address the annual meeting of the
American Institute of Chemical Engineers.
    "We're trying to grow in that area to cushion the oil price
volatility," Hall said.
    Hall said Ashland is seeking a chemical company acquisition
which would complement its existing chemical businesses which
manufacture adhesives, polyester resins and other products.
    When asked if Ashland is considering divesting its
money-losing oil exploration and production unit, he said "we
do not have any spin-offs planned at this time."
    Hall said the Ashland, Ky., based oil company would have
strong margins on its chemical products throughout 1987, adding
"right now we're struggling a bid" with the company's refining
and marketing margins.
    The Ashland chairman also said he hoped the U.S. government
would consider some form of tax incentive to help develop
costly synthetic fuels such as oil shales and coal
liquification. "The lead time on that (kind of project) is so
long, it's difficult for a private company or a company with
shareholders to pay for reseach," he explained.

<BODY>French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac
called on leading Western nations to set up a mechanism which
would put a stop to volatile foreign exchange rates.
    In a speech prepared for delivery to businessmen and
bankers in New York, Chirac said said monetary stablility was a
key element in bringing the world financial system back to
health.
    "The industrialized states should agree to set up a monetary
framework which would provide the necessary stability as well
as sufficient flexibility to allow ajustments when needed,"
Chirac said.
    "This requires a monitoring and alert mechanism which would
permit a timely and concerted reaction," he said.
    The prime minister, on the first day of a three-day visit
to the United States, said the February 22 Paris accords agreed
by the "Group of Five" industrial nations should serve as a basis
for the new mechanism.
     Under the Paris accords, the United States, Britain,
France, West Germany, and Japan agreed to stabilize exchange
rates around existing parities. But, only five weeks after they
were signed, they have failed to stop the dollar tumbling to
record lows against the yen.
    Chirac said the means to monitor exchange rate movements
were readily available. "What is needed is the political will to
use these more completely, in the spirit of the Paris
accords... "
    In other points of his speech, Chirac called on countries
with high trade surpluses -- an apparent reference to Japan --
to open up their markets and stimulate demand.
    He warned the United States that protectionist measures as
debated in the U.S. Congress would bring a tough  response from
the 12-nation European Community.
    "Europe is very sensitive to every rumour of protectionism.
It will react with energy and solidarity because it does not
want to ruin its chances of recovery."
    The Reagan administration is seeking to tone down a tough
trade bill which if passed would require the president to
retaliate against countries deemed to discriminate against U.S.
Goods.
    Chirac also appealed for an effort from developed countries
to help the Third World by reducing interest rates and
stimulating commodity prices.
    "No stock-pile mechanism can run counter to the underlying
trend of the market. These agreements must be complemented by
financial aid to the developing countries hardest hit by the
decline."
    Chirac said he hoped concrete steps could be reached on
these issues at forthcoming international meetings -- the
International Monetary Fund/World Bank session in Washington
and the June summit of seven leading western nations in Venice.

<BODY>Texaco Inc said it has filed
a motion with the Texas Court of Appeals in Houston seeking a
rehearing of the court's decision to uphold most of Pennzoil
Co's 11.12 billion dlr judgment against Texaco.
    The company said its motion cites over 200 errors contained
in the February 12 appeals court decision, adding its "brief
simply 'rubberstamps' the original trial court judgment which
the company has said 'riddled with errors'."
    In support of its argument, Texaco's motion emphasized a
recent case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit in Chicago in Skycom Corp v. Telstar Corp as
"unequivocal confirmation that the Texas Court's opinion is
wrong," according to Gibson Gayle, a Texaco attorney with the
Houston firm of Fulbright and Jaworski.
    "The United States Court of Appeals in Chicago issued the
ruling based on facts strikingly similar to the facts in the
Texaco-Pennzoil litigation," he said.
    "The question before the (federal appeals) court was
whether an "agreement in principle' subject to execution of
'formal documents' is a contract according to New York law.
    "The answer by the court was a resounding 'No' -- precisely
opposite the answer given by the Appellate Court in Texas,"
Gayle said.
    "The United States Court of appeals reached this decision
for the identical reasons that Texas and the Attorney General
of New York have cited in their briefs before the Texas
appellate court," he pointed out.
    "Texaco has consistently maintained that Pennzoil did not
have a binding contract to Buy Getty Oil shares, since a press
release announced only an 'agreement in principle' which was
'subject to the execution of a definitive merger agreement',"
according to Gayle.

<BODY>City Resources Ltd said it has agreed
in principle to sell a 50 pct interest in a group of mineral
properties in the southwest Pacific to a buyer it did not name
for 30 mln Canadian dlrs.
    The company said a preliminary estimate of the geological
resources of one of the properties to a depth of 200 meters
indicates a potential of 1.2 mln ounces of gold, and by the
middle of 1987 it expects to establish proven ore reserves
containing at least 500,000 ounces of gold. Mining could start
in 1988, subject to a satisfactory feasibility study.
    The company said completion of the transaction is subject
to regulatory and shareholder approvals.
    City Resources is controlled by City Resources Ltd of
Australia.

<BODY>The Governor of the Central Bank of
West African CFA franc zone countries (UMOA) today urged that
the bank should be involved in all negotiations with the
International Monetary Fund but said the zone's seven member
countries were not thinking of ditching the fund.
    Abdoulaye Fadiga told reporters after a regular one-day
meeting of UMOA finance ministers here that the bank's
participation in future credit talks with the IMF would promote
a greater coherence in Fund aid granted to the region.
    But he stresed that UMOA, which last month called for a new
relationship with the IMF, was not contemplating a break with
the fund.
    "Member states (of UMOA) never envisaged breaking with the
Fund," he said.
    He said an extraordinary UMOA meeting held in Ivory Coast's
inland capital, Yamoussoukro, last month, stresssed the need
for growth-oriented IMF adjustment policies.
    "Borrowing to pay off debts cannot be a solution," Fadiga
added.
    UMOA members are Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali,
Niger, Senegal and Togo. The zone's common-curreny, the CFA
franc, is pegged to the French franc at the rate of 50 CFA
francs to one French franc.
    Fadiga said many of the region's problems stem from low
commodity prices and a weak dollar.
    He applauded last week's agreement between producers and
consumers on the functioning of a new international cocoa pact,
saying negotiation of other commodity accords would benefit
UMOA countries.

<BODY>Investors who have been riding the
bull market in U.S. stocks got a stinging reminder today of how
unexpected news can trigger sharp reversals.
    "The market was ripe for some type of pullback," said Frank
Korth, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. He said over the
weekend, investors pondered President Reagan's decision to
impose tariffs on Japanese electronic goods and some concluded
the step could signal the beginning of a trade war.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 79 points in 30
minutes before stabilizing and making a partial recovery.
    Korth believes there has been an over-reaction and
near-term traders might want to step in and buy one-half or
one-quarter of new investments they have been considering.
    "We're still in a bull market," said William Raftery of
Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. He thinks history has shown
such sharp pullbacks are a natural part of bull markets. "The
bear usually strikes slowly," he said.
    Raftery noted that blue chips have been forefront of the
rally that took the market to record highs last week. In
today's decline, he said, the big name stocks were coming more
into a more normal alignment with the general market.
    Charles Comer of Moseley Securities Corp said ultimately
the pullback could prove to be a pre-shock to the long awaited
correction. But for now he believes the bull market remains
intact. However, it could take several weeks for the market to
complete a "distribution process" and along the way there will
be rallies.
    Comer thinks it is premature to conclude that today's
action signaled formation of a market top. He thinks the market
can hold in the low to mid 2200 area on the Dow index.
    "This probably is the correction that has been expected,"
said Crandall Hays of Robert W. Baird Co.
    Hays noted that market breadth began to deteriorate last
week. He said this morning investors saw the dollar down
further, interest rates up and gold up. "The trade problem got
people spooked and and all the bad things were happening at
once," he said.
    "This correction could take us down 150 points and we're
half-way there now," he said early today.
    He thinks the downward move in stock prices could be over
in a couple of weeks. Business conditions seem to be getting
better according to what he hears from a broad cross-section of
companies, from retailers to machinery manufacturers.
    "The market was high and people were looking for a
correction, so this was an excuse for the market to go down,"
said Alan Ackerman of Gruntal and Co.
    He believes investors will be in a mood of extreme caution
or slightly negative for the near term.
    Ackerman thinks the U.S. is attempting to "fire a shot
across Japan's bow and let them know we're serious about having
closer trade ties." But nevertheless investors have been
rattled by "a perception that a full scale trade war is
possible." Ultimately, unless there is an accord, the effects
could be higher interest rates and unemployment, he said.
    "I anticipate a further correction later this week," said
Harry Laubscher of Tucker Anthony, R.L. Day. He thinks the
pullback was "the start of an overdue correction of between six
and 10 pct from the market highs."
    Although investors now have new reason to worry about
higher interests rate and a return of inflation, Laubscher
says, "it is not the end of the bull market."
    "The market was looking for a reason to knock itself down a
little bit, and with the trade sanctions coming largely as a
surprise, this was the think the market attached itself to,"
said Gary Ciminero of Fleet Financial Group.

<BODY>U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in
Paris last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection
with their pact to stabilise currencies.
    Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about why
the participating countries had not announced any bands, Lawson
replied, "we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to."
When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float
with set ranges was arranged in Paris, Lawson said "I do not
want to reveal the precise nature of the agreement, so as not
to make it easy for" speculation against the accord.
    Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individual
countries would take corrective action if their currency began
reacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors.
    But if such movements were due to extraneous factors,
Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid
through concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges.
    "It is clear that both Germany and Japan are having
difficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate
appreciations and making their economies more domestically
oriented, just as it is taking time for the United States to
make its own economy more export oriented," Lawson said.
    In his oral evidence to Parliament's Select Treasury
Committee, Lawson repeated that he was happy with the pound's
current level, adding that "It is an objective ... To try to
keep it around that level."
    He said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges had
changed since the steep drop in oil prices, largely because the
pound had weathered that period so successfully. "There has been
a reassessment of sterling's fundamentals," Lawson said.  He
disagreed with what he termed "the grossly exaggerated claim"
that real U.K. Interest rates were much higher than those of
other major industrialsed countries.
    Using as a reference the key three-month sterling interbank
rate as quoted in London, Lawson said Britain now had a real
interest rate level of 5.75 pct - the same as Japan did and
only a 0.75 percentaage point above the Group of Five average.
    Lawson confirmed that "over the medium and longer term, the
government's objective is zero inflation."
    He said the government's intention of its PSBR constant at
1.0 pct of GDP "is the modern equivalent of the balanced budget
doctrine."  He added that "to allow the debt/GDP ratio to remain
constant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simply
a recipe for accelerating inflation."
